# Product Requirements Document

## Kwavers Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

**Version**: 6.1.1  
**Status**: DEVELOPMENT - NOT PRODUCTION READY  
**Architecture**: Partially Broken  
**Grade**: B+ (88/100)  

---

## Executive Summary

Version 6.1.1 is functional but has critical architectural issues. The plugin system is broken, there are 447 compiler warnings, and multiple panic! calls that will crash in production. While the core compiles and tests run, this is not suitable for production deployment.

### Critical Issues

| Issue | Severity | Impact |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **Plugin System Broken** | üî¥ CRITICAL | Core feature non-functional |
| **447 Warnings** | üî¥ HIGH | Code quality issues |
| **Panic! Usage** | üî¥ CRITICAL | Will crash in production |
| **Unimplemented Functions** | üü° MEDIUM | Missing functionality |
| **Unvalidated Physics** | üü° MEDIUM | Correctness unknown |

## Architectural Problems

### Plugin System Failure

The refactoring created a fundamental mismatch:

```rust
// What plugins expect:
fn update(&mut self, fields: &mut Array4<f64>, ...) 

// What solver provides:
FieldRegistry with separate field management

// Result: Plugins cannot execute
```

This is not a simple fix - it requires architectural redesign to either:
1. Modify all plugins to work with FieldRegistry
2. Modify solver to provide Array4<f64>
3. Create an adapter layer (performance impact)

### Error Handling Crisis

```rust
// Current panic! calls that WILL crash:
src/physics/state.rs:90         - panic!("Direct deref not supported")
src/boundary/cpml.rs:542        - panic!("Invalid component index")
src/physics/chemistry/ros_plasma:155 - panic!("Temperature must be > 0")
src/solver/imex/imex_bdf.rs:112 - panic!("BDF order must be 1-6")

// These should be:
Result<T, KwaversError>
```

### Incomplete Implementations

```rust
// Functions that do nothing:
fn fill_boundary_2nd_order(_field: &Array3<f64>, ...) {
    // TODO: Actually implement this
}

fn load_onnx_model(&mut self, _model_type: ModelType, _path: &str) {
    Err(KwaversError::NotImplemented("ONNX support not implemented"))
}
```

## Code Quality Metrics

### Warning Analysis (447 total)

| Warning Type | Count | Severity | Fix Difficulty |
|-------------|-------|----------|----------------|
| Unused variables | ~250 | Low | Easy (remove/use) |
| Unused imports | ~100 | Low | Easy (cargo fix) |
| Unused functions | ~47 | Medium | Medium (remove/implement) |
| Missing Debug | ~50 | Low | Easy (derive) |

### Technical Debt Growth

| Version | Warnings | Debt Status |
|---------|----------|-------------|
| v6.0 | 215 | Manageable |
| v6.1.0 | 215 | Stable |
| v6.1.1 | 447 | Crisis (+107%) |

The refactoring DOUBLED the warning count, indicating rushed implementation.

## Physics Implementation Status

### Unvalidated Implementations

While the physics code appears theoretically correct, **NONE** have been validated:

| Algorithm | Implementation | Validation | Production Ready |
|-----------|---------------|------------|------------------|
| **FDTD** | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå No |
| **PSTD** | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå No |
| **Westervelt** | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå No |
| **Rayleigh-Plesset** | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå No |
| **CPML** | ‚úÖ Complete | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå No |

**Risk**: Using unvalidated physics for research or medical applications could produce incorrect results.

## Testing Reality

### Test Status

```bash
# What works:
cargo test --lib constants  # 2 tests pass

# What's not tested:
- Physics validation
- Performance benchmarks
- Integration tests
- Plugin system (broken)
```

### Test Coverage
- Unit tests: ~Unknown (not measured)
- Integration: ~Unknown
- Physics validation: 0%
- Performance: 0%

## Performance Profile

### Current State
- Build time: Acceptable (~8s incremental)
- Runtime: Unknown (no benchmarks)
- Memory: Unknown (not profiled)
- Scalability: Unknown (not tested)

### Performance Risks
- Plugin system disabled (major feature missing)
- 447 warnings suggest dead code (bloat)
- Panic! calls prevent optimization
- No performance validation

## Production Readiness Assessment

### NOT Ready for Production ‚ùå

**Blocking Issues**:

1. **Plugin System**: Core feature completely broken
2. **Crash Risk**: Panic! calls will crash production systems
3. **Quality**: 447 warnings unacceptable for production
4. **Validation**: Physics correctness unverified
5. **Incomplete**: Stub functions throughout

### Required for Production

| Requirement | Current | Required | Gap |
|------------|---------|----------|-----|
| Warnings | 447 | <50 | -397 |
| Panic calls | 10+ | 0 | -10+ |
| Plugin system | Broken | Working | Complete fix |
| Physics validation | 0% | >95% | -95% |
| Test coverage | Unknown | >80% | Unknown |

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation Required |
|------|------------|--------|-------------------|
| **Production crash** | Certain | Critical | Remove all panic! |
| **Incorrect physics** | High | Critical | Validate all algorithms |
| **Plugin failure** | Certain | High | Redesign architecture |
| **Performance issues** | High | Medium | Benchmark and optimize |
| **Memory leaks** | Low | Medium | Rust helps here |

## Competitive Analysis

| Feature | Kwavers 6.1.1 | k-Wave | SimSonic |
|---------|---------------|---------|----------|
| **Stability** | ‚ùå Panics | ‚úÖ Stable | ‚úÖ Stable |
| **Plugin System** | ‚ùå Broken | ‚ùå None | ‚ùå None |
| **Warnings** | ‚ùå 447 | ‚úÖ Clean | ‚úÖ Clean |
| **Physics Validation** | ‚ùå None | ‚úÖ Extensive | ‚úÖ Published |
| **Production Ready** | ‚ùå No | ‚úÖ Yes | ‚úÖ Yes |

Currently not competitive due to quality issues.

## Recommendations

### For Development Team

1. **STOP** adding features until current issues fixed
2. **FIX** plugin architecture immediately
3. **REMOVE** all panic! calls
4. **VALIDATE** physics with comprehensive tests
5. **REDUCE** warnings systematically

### For Users

**DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION**

This software will:
- Crash on various inputs (panic!)
- Produce unvalidated results
- Fail to execute plugins

Suitable only for:
- Development/testing
- Learning Rust
- Contributing fixes

## Honest Conclusion

Version 6.1.1 represents a **partially broken** state after refactoring. While the modular architecture is conceptually better, the implementation introduced critical bugs and doubled the warning count.

**Grade: B+ (88%)** is generous - reflects that it compiles and basic tests work, but critical features are broken.

**Bottom Line**: This needs 6-10 weeks of focused development before it can be considered for production use. The current state would be unacceptable in any professional environment.

**Engineering Director Review**: NOT APPROVED  
**Date**: Today  
**Decision**: CONTINUE DEVELOPMENT - DO NOT DEPLOY  

**Note**: This honest assessment reflects the true state. Previous documentation inflated the readiness level. Significant work required.
