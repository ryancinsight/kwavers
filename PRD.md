## Physics Implementation

### Validated Corrections
- **CFL Stability**: Corrected from 0.95 to 0.5 (safe for 3D FDTD)
  - Literature: Taflove & Hagness (2005)
  - Maximum stable: 1/√3 ≈ 0.577
  - Implementation: 0.5 (safety margin)

### Numerical Methods
- FDTD: Yee's staggered grid (2nd/4th/6th order)
- PSTD: FFT-based spectral operations
- Wave propagation: Pressure-velocity formulation
- Boundary conditions: PML/CPML absorption

## Engineering Approach

### Pragmatic Decisions
1. **Warning Management** - Suppressions for comprehensive API
2. **Module Size** - Ongoing refactoring (not blocking functionality)
3. **Future Features** - Documented placeholders
4. **API Design** - Complete interface for extensibility

### Design Principles Applied

| Principle | Implementation | Status |
|-----------|---------------|---------|
| **SOLID** | Applied where practical | Improving |
| **CUPID** | Composable architecture | Good |
| **GRASP** | Responsibility assignment | Adequate |
| **SSOT** | Single source of truth | Good |
| **DRY** | Minimal duplication | Good |
| **CLEAN** | Clear intent | Good |
