# Product Requirements Document

## Kwavers Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

**Version**: 2.15.0  
**Status**: Production Ready with Caveats  
**Grade**: B+ (Good Quality, Needs Refinement)  
**Last Review**: Current Session  

---

## Executive Summary

Kwavers is a functional acoustic wave simulation library implementing FDTD and simplified PSTD solvers with comprehensive physics models. The codebase demonstrates good Rust practices but requires structural refinement to achieve elite engineering standards.

### Current State
- ✅ **All Tests Passing** - 16/16 test suites successful
- ✅ **Clean Build** - Compiles without errors
- ✅ **Physics Validated** - Core algorithms match literature
- ⚠️ **Module Organization** - Several files exceed 500 lines
- ⚠️ **Technical Debt** - Some TODOs and underscored variables remain

## Technical Assessment

### Component Quality Matrix

| Component | Lines | Status | Issues | Grade |
|-----------|-------|--------|--------|-------|
| FDTD Solver | 1138 | Working | Too large, needs splitting | B |
| PSTD Solver | ~400 | Working | Uses FD instead of spectral | B |
| Chemistry Module | 964* | Refactored | Split into 3 files | B+ |
| Plugin System | ~900 | Working | Complex but functional | B |
| Grid Management | ~300 | Complete | Well structured | A |
| Boundary Conditions | 918 | Working | Could be split | B |

*After refactoring from 998 lines

### Code Quality Metrics
- **Total Source Files**: 369 (excessive for project scope)
- **Largest Files**: 8 files > 900 lines (needs splitting)
- **Test Coverage**: Core paths covered
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive with literature references
- **Warning Suppressions**: Removed (was hiding issues)

## Design Principles Adherence

### SOLID Compliance
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Violated in large modules (B-)
- **O**pen/Closed: Good plugin architecture (A-)
- **L**iskov Substitution: Trait implementations correct (A)
- **I**nterface Segregation: Mostly good, some large traits (B+)
- **D**ependency Inversion: Good use of traits (A-)

### Other Principles
- **SSOT/SPOT**: Improved after removing redundant docs (B+)
- **CUPID**: Composable but overly complex (B)
- **GRASP**: Mixed - some modules have too many responsibilities (B-)
- **DRY**: Some duplication in test code (B)
- **CLEAN**: Good naming, but module size issues (B+)

## Issues Addressed in Review

### Fixed
1. ✅ Removed 66MB of binary files from repository
2. ✅ Deleted 4 redundant documentation files
3. ✅ Removed blanket warning suppressions
4. ✅ Split chemistry module (998→3 files)
5. ✅ Fixed missing test imports

### Remaining
1. ⚠️ 8 modules > 900 lines need splitting
2. ⚠️ 4 TODO comments in code
3. ⚠️ Several underscored variables (possible dead code)
4. ⚠️ Magic numbers in some modules
5. ⚠️ 30 examples (excessive, 5-10 would suffice)

## Physics Implementation Quality

### Validated Components
- **FDTD Algorithm**: Correctly implements Yee scheme with proper CFL conditions
- **Wave Propagation**: Accurate pressure-velocity formulation
- **Boundary Conditions**: PML/CPML properly absorbing
- **Medium Modeling**: Correct acoustic impedance calculations

### Known Limitations
- **PSTD**: Uses finite differences, not true spectral methods
- **GPU Support**: Stub implementations only
- **Parallel Scaling**: Limited benchmarking data

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Mitigation | Status |
|------|----------|------------|--------|
| Module Complexity | Medium | Split large files | In Progress |
| Technical Debt | Low | Address TODOs | Pending |
| Performance | Low | Profile and optimize | Future |
| Maintainability | Medium | Refactor structure | In Progress |

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. Split all modules > 500 lines into logical submodules
2. Convert magic numbers to named constants
3. Remove or implement underscored variables
4. Address TODO comments

### Near-term Improvements
1. Reduce example count from 30 to 5-10 focused demos
2. Implement proper spectral methods for PSTD
3. Add CI/CD pipeline for automated testing
4. Create module dependency graph to identify coupling

### Long-term Goals
1. GPU acceleration implementation
2. Distributed computing support
3. Performance optimization based on profiling
4. Comprehensive benchmarking suite

## Conclusion

Kwavers is a functional acoustic simulation library with solid physics foundations but requires structural refinement to meet elite engineering standards. The core algorithms are correct and well-documented, but the codebase organization needs improvement to enhance maintainability and scalability.

**Current Grade**: B+ (Good Quality, Functional)  
**Target Grade**: A (Elite Engineering)  
**Effort Required**: ~2-3 weeks of refactoring
