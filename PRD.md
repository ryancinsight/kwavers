## Physics Validation

### Verified Algorithms
- **FDTD**: Correctly implements Yee's staggered grid scheme
- **Wave Equation**: Proper pressure-velocity formulation
- **CFL Condition**: Stability criteria enforced
- **Boundary Conditions**: PML/CPML properly absorbing
- **Medium Properties**: Accurate impedance calculations

### Literature Compliance
All core algorithms cross-referenced with:
- Yee (1966) - Original FDTD formulation
- Virieux (1986) - Velocity-stress formulation
- Treeby & Cox (2010) - k-Wave validation
- Moczo et al. (2014) - Comprehensive FDTD reference

---

## Known Limitations

### Technical Debt
1. **Large Modules** - 8 files exceed 900 lines
2. **PSTD Implementation** - Uses finite differences, not FFT
3. **GPU Support** - Stub implementations only
4. **Warnings** - 479 unused code warnings from comprehensive API

### Acceptable Trade-offs
- Simplified PSTD for stability over theoretical accuracy
- Plugin complexity for extensibility
- Comprehensive API causing unused warnings
- Clone operations for safety over performance

---

## Performance Characteristics

### Current Metrics
- **Build Time**: ~45s release mode
- **Test Execution**: ~15s full suite
- **Memory Usage**: Efficient, no leaks detected
- **Runtime**: Suitable for research/education

### Optimization Opportunities
- Profile-guided optimization not yet applied
