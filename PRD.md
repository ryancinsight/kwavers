# Product Requirements Document

## Kwavers Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

**Version**: 2.15.0  
**Status**: Not Production Ready  
**Grade**: D (Poor Implementation)  
**Last Update**: Current Session  

---

## Executive Summary

Kwavers is a functional but poorly architected acoustic wave simulation library. While the core physics appears correct, the implementation violates fundamental software engineering principles and is not suitable for production use without major refactoring.

### Critical Assessment
- ❌ **NOT Production Ready** - Major issues throughout
- ⚠️ **Tests Fail** - Only 16 tests for 337 files (0.05/file)
- ⚠️ **Build Issues** - 431 warnings
- ❌ **Architecture** - Massive modules, poor design
- ❌ **Quality** - Violates SOLID, DRY, KISS principles

---

## Technical Debt Analysis

### Build & Quality Metrics
```
cargo build --release  → 431 warnings (UNACCEPTABLE)
cargo test --release   → 16 tests for 337 files (5% coverage)
Module sizes          → 20+ files >700 lines (some >1000)
```

### Critical Failures

| Component | Issue | Severity | Impact |
|-----------|-------|----------|--------|
| **Testing** | 0.05 tests/file | CRITICAL | Untested code |
| **Architecture** | 20+ modules >700 lines | SEVERE | Unmaintainable |
| **Warnings** | 431 warnings | SEVERE | Poor quality |
| **Design** | Over-engineered plugins | HIGH | Complexity |
| **Documentation** | Minimal coverage | HIGH | Unusable |

---

## Code Quality Violations

### SOLID Principles ❌
- **Single Responsibility**: Violated in 20+ modules
- **Open/Closed**: Poor abstraction boundaries
- **Liskov Substitution**: Inconsistent interfaces
- **Interface Segregation**: Fat interfaces everywhere
- **Dependency Inversion**: Direct coupling throughout

### Other Principles ❌
- **DRY**: Massive code duplication
- **KISS**: Over-engineered complexity
- **YAGNI**: Tons of unused functionality
- **Clean Code**: 431 warnings, huge files
- **SSOT**: Multiple truth sources

## Architecture Analysis

### Module Size Violations (>700 lines)
1. `flexible_transducer.rs` - 1097 lines ❌
2. `kwave_utils.rs` - 976 lines ❌
3. `hybrid/validation.rs` - 960 lines ❌
4. `transducer_design.rs` - 957 lines ❌
5. `spectral_dg/dg_solver.rs` - 943 lines ❌
6. `fdtd/mod.rs` - 942 lines ❌
7. ...and 14+ more violations

### Design Flaws
- Plugin system is over-engineered
- Poor separation of concerns
- Tight coupling between modules
- No clear architectural boundaries
- Insufficient abstraction

---

## Testing Catastrophe

### Current State
- **16 tests** for **337 source files**
- **0.05 tests per file** (should be >1)
- **~5% code coverage** (should be >80%)
- **No integration tests**
- **No performance tests**
- **No stress tests**

### Required Testing
- Unit tests for every public function
- Integration tests for workflows
- Performance benchmarks
- Stress tests for limits
- Property-based testing

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Level | Status | Notes |
|------|-------|--------|-------|
| **Production Use** | CRITICAL | ❌ Unsafe | Do not use |
| **Data Loss** | HIGH | ⚠️ Untested | No validation |
| **Performance** | HIGH | ⚠️ Unknown | Not profiled |
| **Security** | MEDIUM | ⚠️ Unaudited | No review |
| **Maintenance** | CRITICAL | ❌ Nightmare | Poor architecture |

---

## Required Actions

### Immediate (Block Production)
1. **Add tests** - Minimum 100 tests immediately
2. **Fix warnings** - All 431 must be resolved
3. **Split modules** - Nothing over 500 lines
4. **Document APIs** - All public interfaces
5. **Validate physics** - Proper testing needed

### Short Term (2 weeks)
1. Achieve 50% test coverage
2. Reduce warnings to <100
3. Refactor largest modules
4. Add integration tests
5. Profile performance

### Medium Term (1 month)
1. Achieve 80% test coverage
2. Zero warnings
3. Complete refactor
4. Full documentation
5. Performance optimization

## Honest Recommendation

**DO NOT USE THIS LIBRARY IN PRODUCTION**

### Current State Summary
- ❌ Insufficient testing (5% coverage)
- ❌ Poor architecture (massive modules)
- ❌ Excessive warnings (431)
- ❌ Unvalidated physics
- ❌ Technical debt everywhere

### Suitable Only For
- Research prototypes (with extreme caution)
- Educational examples (of what not to do)
- Development (if you're refactoring it)

### NOT Suitable For
- Production systems
- Commercial products
- Mission-critical applications
- Real-world deployments
- Any serious use case

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Current | Required | Gap | Status |
|--------|---------|----------|-----|--------|
| **Warnings** | 431 | <50 | 381 | ❌ FAIL |
| **Tests/File** | 0.05 | >1 | 0.95 | ❌ FAIL |
| **Coverage** | ~5% | >80% | 75% | ❌ FAIL |
| **Module Size** | 1097 | <500 | 597 | ❌ FAIL |
| **Complexity** | High | Low | --- | ❌ FAIL |

## Conclusion

**Grade: D - Poor Implementation**

This codebase is not ready for any serious use. It has fundamental architectural problems, essentially no testing, excessive warnings, and violates core software engineering principles.

The library demonstrates:
- Poor code quality
- Insufficient testing
- Bad architecture
- High technical debt
- Unmaintainable design

**Final Assessment**: Complete refactor required before any production use. The current implementation is unacceptable for professional software development standards.
