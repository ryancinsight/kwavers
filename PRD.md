## Engineering Philosophy

### Continuous Elevation Principles
1. **Never Break Working Code** - Improvements must maintain functionality
2. **Iterative Progress** - Small improvements compound over time
3. **User Value First** - Focus on what helps users today
4. **Pragmatic Solutions** - Working beats perfect every time
5. **No Rewrites** - Elevate what exists, don't start over

### Development Strategy
```
Current State → Identify Issues → Fix Incrementally → Test → Deploy → Repeat
     ↑                                                                    ↓
