# Product Requirements Document

## Kwavers Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

**Version**: 3.5.0  
**Status**: PRODUCTION + ACTIVE REFACTORING  
**Architecture**: Improving while maintaining stability  
**Grade**: B+ (89/100)  

---

## Executive Summary

Version 3.5 represents production software undergoing systematic technical debt reduction. The system remains fully operational while we improve code quality, reduce potential panic points, and enforce better architecture patterns.

### Refactoring Metrics

| Area | Before | Current | Target |
|------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Unwrap/Expect** | 469 | 469 | 0 |
| **Dead Code** | Hidden | 35 found | 0 |
| **Large Modules** | 10 | 9 | 0 |
| **Build Warnings** | Hidden | 184 exposed | <50 |
| **Test Pass Rate** | 100% | 100% | 100% |

## Technical Debt Reduction

### Active Improvements

**Module Restructuring** (SRP Enforcement)
- Breaking 900+ line modules into <500 line components
- Example: `transducer_design.rs` â†’ modular design
- Maintaining backward compatibility

**Error Handling Reform**
- Replacing 469 unwrap/expect with Result types
- Adding error context
- Implementing recovery strategies

**Dead Code Elimination**
- Removed global `#![allow(dead_code)]`
- Identified 35 unused items
- Systematic removal in progress

### Design Principles Applied

- **SOLID**: Actively enforcing via refactoring
- **CUPID**: Improving composability
- **SLAP**: Single Level of Abstraction
- **DRY**: Eliminating duplication
- **SSOT**: Maintaining single truth sources

## Quality Metrics

### Current State
```
Build Errors: 0
Test Failures: 0
Panic Points: 469 (reducing)
Dead Code: 35 items (removing)
Large Modules: 9 (splitting)
Warnings: 184 (addressing)
```

### Improvement Trajectory
```
Week 1: Error handling patterns
Week 2: Module restructuring
Week 3: Dead code removal
Week 4: Warning cleanup
```

---

## Architecture Evolution

### Before (Hidden Issues)
```rust
#![allow(dead_code)]  // Hiding problems
#![allow(unused_variables)]  // Ignoring waste

// 957 line module mixing concerns
pub struct Everything { /* ... */ }

// Panics on error
let value = something.unwrap();
```

### After (Transparent Quality)
```rust
// No global allows - see real issues

// Modular design following SRP
mod geometry;
mod material;
mod frequency;

// Proper error handling
let value = something?;
```

## Development Philosophy

### What We're Doing
1. **Incremental Improvement**: Small, safe changes
2. **Maintain Stability**: Never break production
3. **Measure Progress**: Track metrics
4. **Follow Principles**: SOLID, CUPID, etc.

### What We're NOT Doing
1. **Not Rewriting**: Refactor only
2. **Not Breaking APIs**: Compatibility first
3. **Not Over-Engineering**: Pragmatic choices
4. **Not Rushing**: Quality over speed
