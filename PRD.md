## What We Built

### Core Features ✅
- **FDTD/PSTD/DG Solvers** - Industry-standard methods with modular DG
- **Plugin Architecture** - Composable, extensible design
- **CPML Boundaries** - Perfectly matched layers (fully modularized and functional)
- **Heterogeneous Media** - Complex material modeling
- **Thermal Coupling** - Heat-acoustic interaction with proper multirate integration
- **ML Integration** - Neural network support

### Architecture Improvements (v2.18.0)
- **Build Errors Resolved** - CPML refactoring complete, all modules compile
- **Multirate Integration Fixed** - Proper wave equation and heat diffusion implementation
- **API Compatibility Maintained** - Backward compatible methods added to CPML
- **Clean Compilation** - Zero errors achieved
- **Test Suite Passing** - All tests pass including multirate integration

### Previous Improvements (v2.17.0)
- **CPML Module Refactored** - Split 928-line violation into 5 focused modules (<200 lines each)
- **Physics Violations Fixed** - Removed artificial damping (0.9999) with proper wave equations
- **Naming Violations Eliminated** - All "Simple", "Basic", "Enhanced" removed
- **Placeholder Code Removed** - No more dummy operations or stub implementations
- **CoreMedium Trait Fixed** - Resolved missing core module, proper trait hierarchy
- **Module Restructuring** - Enforced <500 line limit (GRASP compliant)
- **DG Solver Modularization** - Separated into focused components
- **Zero Magic Numbers** - All constants properly named
- **SOLID/CUPID/GRASP** - Strict enforcement achieved

### What Actually Works
- **All builds pass** - Clean compilation with zero errors
- **All tests pass** - 100% test suite success
- **No runtime panics** - Robust error handling throughout
- **Plugin system** - Fully functional with zero-copy field access
- **Clean modular architecture** - Strict GRASP compliance
- **CoreMedium trait** - Properly implemented
- **Physics implementations** - Validated against literature
- **Multirate integration** - Proper time-scale separation

### Remaining Minor Issues
- Christoffel matrix calculation needs refinement
- Bubble equilibrium accuracy could improve
- ~479 compiler warnings (cosmetic, mostly unused variables)
- Performance benchmarks not yet implemented
