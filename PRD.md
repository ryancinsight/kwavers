# Product Requirements Document

## Kwavers Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

**Version**: 2.15.0  
**Status**: NOT Production Ready  
**Grade**: D (Major Issues)  
**Last Update**: Current Session  

---

## Executive Summary

Kwavers is an acoustic wave simulation library with fundamental architectural problems that prevent production use. While tests pass, the codebase has severe violations of basic software engineering principles, making it unmaintainable and unreliable for serious applications.

### Critical Assessment
- ❌ **NOT Production Ready** - Major refactoring required
- ⚠️ **324 Warnings** - Significant dead code and incomplete implementations
- ⚠️ **20+ Module Violations** - Files exceed 500 lines (worst: 1097)
- ⚠️ **21 Placeholders** - Critical functionality missing
- ✅ **Tests Pass** - But insufficient coverage (16 tests only)

## Technical Debt Analysis

### Severity: CRITICAL

| Issue | Count | Impact |
|-------|-------|--------|
| **Modules >500 lines** | 20+ | Unmaintainable, violates SRP |
| **Compiler Warnings** | 324 | Dead code, incomplete implementations |
| **TODO/Placeholders** | 21 | Missing critical functionality |
| **Underscored Variables** | 13+ | Unused code, incomplete logic |
| **Test Coverage** | <10% | Insufficient validation |

### Module Size Violations (Top 10)

| Module | Lines | Violation |
|--------|-------|-----------|
| `source/flexible_transducer.rs` | 1097 | +119% over limit |
| `utils/kwave_utils.rs` | 976 | +95% over limit |
| `solver/hybrid/validation.rs` | 960 | +92% over limit |
| `source/transducer_design.rs` | 957 | +91% over limit |
| `solver/fdtd/mod.rs` | 949 | +90% over limit |
| `solver/spectral_dg/dg_solver.rs` | 943 | +89% over limit |
| `sensor/beamforming.rs` | 923 | +85% over limit |
| `boundary/cpml.rs` | 918 | +84% over limit |
| `source/hemispherical_array.rs` | 917 | +83% over limit |
| `medium/heterogeneous/tissue.rs` | 917 | +83% over limit |

## Component Assessment

| Component | Status | Quality | Critical Issues |
|-----------|--------|---------|-----------------|
| **FDTD Solver** | Functional | Poor | 949 lines, needs splitting |
| **PSTD Solver** | Misleading | Poor | Uses finite differences, not spectral |
| **Chemistry** | Incomplete | Poor | Placeholder concentrations |
| **Plugin System** | Over-engineered | Poor | Too complex, needs simplification |
| **Hybrid Solver** | Broken | Failed | Multiple placeholders returning zeros |
| **Tests** | Insufficient | Poor | Only 16 tests for 369 files |

---

## Critical Findings

### 1. Architecture Violations
- **SOLID Violations**: Single Responsibility violated in 20+ modules
- **GRASP Violations**: Poor cohesion, tight coupling throughout
- **SLAP Violations**: Mixed abstraction levels in large modules
- **DRY Violations**: Duplicated logic across modules

### 2. Placeholder Implementations
```rust
// Examples of critical placeholders found:
- hybrid/adaptive_selection.rs: interface_quality = 0.95; // Placeholder
- chemistry/mod.rs: // This is a placeholder - actual implementation would track rates
- hybrid/interpolation.rs: Ok(Array3::zeros(...)) // TODO: Implement
- amr/feature_refinement.rs: 0.0 // Placeholder
```

### 3. Physics Issues
- ✅ CFL corrected from 0.95 to 0.5 (was causing instability)
- ⚠️ PSTD claims spectral but uses finite differences
- ⚠️ Chemistry using dummy concentrations
- ⚠️ Hybrid solver interpolation returns zeros

### 4. Code Quality Metrics
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: Not measured (likely very high)
- **Code Coverage**: <10% (16 tests for 369 files)
- **Technical Debt Ratio**: >40% (based on warnings/LOC)
- **Maintainability Index**: Poor (large modules, high coupling)

## Required Actions (Priority Order)

### Phase 1: Critical Architecture Fixes
1. **Split all 20+ modules >500 lines**
   - Target: <300 lines per module
   - Apply SRP strictly
   - Create proper module hierarchies

2. **Fix 324 warnings**
   - Remove dead code
   - Complete partial implementations
   - Fix unused variables

3. **Replace 21 placeholders**
   - Implement actual algorithms
   - Remove TODO comments
   - Validate against literature

### Phase 2: Quality Improvements
4. **Add comprehensive tests**
   - Target: >80% coverage
   - Unit tests for each module
   - Integration tests for workflows

5. **Refactor plugin architecture**
   - Simplify over-engineered design
   - Remove unnecessary abstractions
   - Improve composability

### Phase 3: Documentation
6. **Update all documentation**
   - Accurate API docs
   - Working examples
   - Architecture diagrams

## Risk Assessment

### Production Use Risks
- **High**: Module size makes debugging nearly impossible
- **High**: Placeholders cause unpredictable behavior
- **High**: Insufficient tests miss critical bugs
- **Medium**: Performance unknown due to architectural issues
- **Medium**: Memory leaks possible from incomplete cleanup

### Maintenance Risks
- **Critical**: Large modules prevent effective maintenance
- **Critical**: Mixed responsibilities make changes risky
- **High**: Dead code creates confusion
- **High**: Poor test coverage prevents safe refactoring

---

## Recommendation

### DO NOT USE IN PRODUCTION

This codebase requires fundamental restructuring before any production use. The current state would lead to:
- Maintenance nightmares
- Unpredictable runtime behavior
- Difficult debugging
- High technical debt accumulation

### Estimated Effort for Production Ready
- **Developer Time**: 3-6 months full-time
- **Refactoring**: Complete rewrite of 20+ modules
- **Testing**: Write 500+ tests
- **Documentation**: Full rewrite

## Version History

| Version | Grade | Status | Notes |
|---------|-------|--------|-------|
| 2.15.0 | D | Not Ready | Major architectural issues identified |
| 2.14.0 | C | Problematic | Warning suppressions removed, issues exposed |
| 2.13.0 | B- | Misleading | Hidden issues with suppressions |

---

## Final Assessment

**Grade: D - Major Issues**

The codebase has fundamental architectural problems that prevent production use. While it compiles and passes minimal tests, the technical debt is overwhelming and the code quality is poor. Significant refactoring is required before this library can be considered for any serious application.

**Recommendation**: Complete rewrite of architecture following proper design principles.
