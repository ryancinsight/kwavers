## Technical Specifications

### Proven Capabilities
```rust
// Production-ready code
let mut solver = PluginBasedSolver::new(grid, time, medium, boundary);
solver.add_plugin(Box::new(AcousticWavePlugin::new(0.95)))?;
solver.initialize()?;
for _ in 0..steps {
    solver.step()?;
}
```

### Grid Support
