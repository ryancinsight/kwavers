## Pragmatic Decisions

### What We're Doing
1. **Fixing what's broken** - Tests and examples first
2. **Accepting stable warnings** - 501 is manageable
3. **Documenting reality** - Honest about state
4. **Prioritizing function** - Working code over perfect code

### What We're NOT Doing
1. **Not creating stubs** - No fake implementations
2. **Not rushing GPU** - Core stability first
3. **Not over-engineering** - YAGNI principle
4. **Not hiding issues** - Transparent about problems

## Conclusion

Kwavers is a **functional alpha** library with:
- ✅ Working core features
- ✅ Solid architecture
- ✅ Clear improvement path
- ✅ Realistic timeline

**Assessment**: The foundation is excellent. With focused effort on tests and examples, the library will reach beta quality in 1-3 months and production readiness in 3-6 months.

**Recommendation**: Continue development with focus on stabilization (tests/examples) before adding new features.
