# Product Requirements Document

## Kwavers Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

**Version**: 2.15.0  
**Status**: Under Development  
**Grade**: C+ (Significant Issues)  
**Last Update**: Current Session  

---

## Executive Summary

Kwavers is an acoustic wave simulation library with significant architectural and quality issues. Despite passing tests, the codebase has 475 warnings, massive module size violations, and contained a critical physics bug. **This is NOT production ready.**

### Critical Findings
- ❌ **475 Warnings** - Hidden by suppressions
- ❌ **Module Violations** - 19 files exceed 500 lines
- ❌ **Physics Bug** - CFL was set to unsafe 0.95 (fixed to 0.5)
- ❌ **Incomplete Code** - Multiple stubs and placeholders
- ❌ **Misleading Docs** - Previous "Grade A-" was false

## Component Quality Assessment

| Component | Lines | Status | Grade |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| **FDTD Solver** | 1138 | Massive violation | F |
| **PSTD Solver** | ~200 | Properly uses FFT | B |
| **Chemistry Module** | 340 | Has placeholders | D |
| **Plugin System** | 892 | Too complex | D |
| **Boundary Conditions** | 918 | Needs splitting | F |
| **Flexible Transducer** | 1097 | Huge violation | F |

---

## Critical Physics Issues

### Fixed in This Review
- **CFL Stability**: Was using 0.95 (unstable), corrected to 0.5
  - Literature: Max stable CFL for 3D FDTD is 1/√3 ≈ 0.577
  - Safety margin applied: using 0.5

### Still Present
- Hardcoded sound speeds (1500 m/s)
- Missing validation against analytical solutions
- Incomplete boundary condition implementations
- Placeholder chemical kinetics

---

## Code Quality - Honest Metrics

### Violations Found
- **Lines of Code**: 19 files > 500 lines (some > 1000)
- **Warnings**: 475 (previously hidden)
- **Dead Code**: Extensive unused imports and variables
- **Stubs**: Multiple placeholder implementations
- **TODOs**: Several unresolved
- **Adjectives**: Found and fixed 6+ violations

### Design Principle Violations

| Principle | Violation | Impact |
|-----------|-----------|--------|
| **SOLID** | Massive files violate SRP | High coupling |
| **CUPID** | Not composable due to size | Hard to maintain |
| **GRASP** | Poor responsibility assignment | Confused architecture |
| **DRY** | Duplication in large modules | Maintenance burden |
| **CLEAN** | 475 warnings = not clean | Technical debt |

---

## Module Size Violations (Top 10)

1. `solver/fdtd/mod.rs` - 1138 lines ❌
2. `source/flexible_transducer.rs` - 1097 lines ❌
3. `utils/kwave_utils.rs` - 976 lines ❌
4. `solver/hybrid/validation.rs` - 960 lines ❌
5. `source/transducer_design.rs` - 957 lines ❌
6. `solver/spectral_dg/dg_solver.rs` - 943 lines ❌
7. `sensor/beamforming.rs` - 923 lines ❌
8. `boundary/cpml.rs` - 918 lines ❌
9. `source/hemispherical_array.rs` - 917 lines ❌
10. `medium/heterogeneous/tissue.rs` - 917 lines ❌

**ALL violate the 500-line maximum!**

---

## Incomplete Implementations

### Stubs/Placeholders Found
- `plot_simulation_outputs` - Removed (was misleading stub)
- Chemistry placeholders - "actual implementation would..."
- Cache metrics - "placeholder for future hardware integration"
- Hybrid solver - "Simple field update placeholder"
- Phase error calculation - TODO

### Missing Validations
- No validation against analytical solutions
- Limited convergence testing
- No performance benchmarks
- Incomplete error propagation

---

## Required Refactoring

### Immediate Actions
1. **Split Large Modules**
   - Break all files > 500 lines
   - Apply single responsibility principle
   - Create proper submodules

2. **Clean Dead Code**
   - Remove 475 warnings worth of unused code
   - Delete unnecessary imports
   - Remove unused variables

3. **Complete Implementations**
   - Replace all placeholders
   - Implement missing features
   - Add proper error handling

4. **Validate Physics**
   - Test against analytical solutions
   - Verify numerical stability
   - Benchmark accuracy

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Severity | Current State | Required Action |
|------|----------|--------------|-----------------|
| **Numerical Instability** | Critical | Partially fixed | Full validation needed |
| **Module Complexity** | High | 19 violations | Urgent refactoring |
| **Dead Code** | High | 475 warnings | Clean immediately |
| **Incomplete Features** | Medium | Multiple stubs | Complete or remove |
| **Documentation** | High | Misleading | Rewrite honestly |

---

## Performance Issues

### Not Properly Assessed
- No benchmarks run
- No profiling done
- Memory usage unknown
- Cache efficiency not measured
- Parallelization not validated

### Known Problems
- Large modules likely have poor cache locality
- Dead code increases binary size
- Complex plugin system adds overhead
- No optimization profiling done

---

## Honest Recommendation

**This codebase is NOT production ready and requires major refactoring.**

### Current State Summary
- Grade: **C+** (Generous)
- Status: **Prototype/Research Quality**
- Production Ready: **NO**
- Medical Use: **ABSOLUTELY NOT**

### Why Previous Assessment Was Wrong
1. Hidden warnings with suppressions (dishonest)
2. Ignored module size violations
3. Overlooked critical physics bugs
4. Accepted placeholder implementations
5. Made false claims about production readiness

### Minimum Requirements for Production
1. Zero warnings without suppressions
2. All modules < 500 lines
3. Complete implementations (no stubs)
4. Full physics validation
5. Comprehensive benchmarks
6. Proper error handling
7. Clean architecture

---

## Time Estimate for Production Ready

Given current state, estimated effort:

| Task | Time | Priority |
|------|------|----------|
| Split large modules | 2-3 weeks | Critical |
| Clean warnings | 1 week | Critical |
| Complete stubs | 2-3 weeks | High |
| Physics validation | 2 weeks | Critical |
| Performance optimization | 1-2 weeks | Medium |
| Documentation | 1 week | Medium |
| **Total** | **9-12 weeks** | - |

---

## Conclusion

The Kwavers library shows promise but has been misrepresented. The previous "Grade A-" assessment was dishonest, hiding serious issues behind warning suppressions and ignoring massive architectural violations.

### Truth About This Codebase
- It's a research prototype, not production software
- Has significant technical debt
- Contains incomplete implementations
- Violates basic software engineering principles
- Had a critical physics bug (now fixed)

### Path Forward
Requires dedicated refactoring effort of 9-12 weeks minimum to reach production quality. Until then, it should be clearly marked as experimental/research software.
