## Recommendations

### For Users
- **Current Use**: Development and experimentation only
- **Not Suitable For**: Production, research, medical applications
- **Timeline**: Check back in 3 months

### For Contributors
Priority contributions:
1. Test fixes (122 errors)
2. Warning cleanup (502)
3. Loop modernization (892)
4. Documentation

### For Stakeholders
- Project shows promise with recent fixes

## Conclusion

Kwavers has made significant progress from a non-compiling state to a buildable library. The successful module refactoring demonstrates good architectural patterns. However, substantial work remains:

- **Positive**: Now compiles, architecture improving
- **Negative**: No tests, high warnings, unvalidated physics
- **Timeline**: 3 months to production readiness
- **Risk**: Medium (reduced from Critical)

The project is transitioning from prototype to alpha quality but requires focused development effort to reach production readiness.
