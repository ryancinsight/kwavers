## Working Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

A comprehensive acoustic wave simulation library implementing FDTD and PSTD solvers. The code is functional and produces correct physics results, though it has technical debt that should be addressed for long-term maintainability.

### Current Status (v2.15.0)
- **Functionality**: ✅ All features work correctly
- **Physics**: ✅ Validated and accurate
- **Tests**: ✅ All tests pass
- **Examples**: ✅ All 7 examples work
- **Build**: ⚠️ 431 warnings (mostly unused code)
- **Architecture**: ⚠️ Some large modules

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run an example
cargo run --release --example basic_simulation

# Run tests
cargo test --release

# Use in your project
```

```toml
[dependencies]
kwavers = "2.15.0"
```

## What Works

### Core Features ✅
- **FDTD Solver** - Finite-difference time domain
- **PSTD Solver** - Pseudo-spectral time domain
- **Plugin Architecture** - Extensible solver system
- **Boundary Conditions** - PML/CPML absorption
- **Medium Modeling** - Homogeneous and heterogeneous
- **Chemistry** - Reaction kinetics
- **Bubble Dynamics** - Cavitation modeling

### Validated Physics ✅
- CFL stability (0.5 for 3D FDTD)
- Wave propagation accuracy
- Energy conservation
- Absorption modeling
- Boundary conditions

## Pragmatic Assessment

### The Good
- **It works** - All functionality is operational
- **Physics is correct** - Validated implementations
- **Examples demonstrate usage** - 7 working examples
- **No critical bugs** - Stable operation

### The Not-So-Good
- **431 warnings** - Mostly unused code from broad API
- **Large modules** - Some files >1000 lines
- **Limited tests** - Critical paths tested, but low coverage
- **Over-engineered in places** - Plugin system is complex

### The Reality
This is a research-grade library that works correctly but needs refactoring for production use. The physics is solid, the API is functional, and it can be used for real simulations. The technical debt is manageable and doesn't affect correctness.

## Usage Recommendations

### Good For
- Research simulations
- Prototype development
- Educational purposes
- Small to medium scale problems
- Proof of concepts

### Consider Alternatives For
- Large-scale production systems (until refactored)
- Performance-critical applications (needs profiling)
- Safety-critical systems (needs more testing)

## Technical Debt

### Module Sizes (Non-Critical)
- 20+ modules exceed 700 lines
- Largest: `flexible_transducer.rs` (1097 lines)
- **Impact**: Harder to maintain, but functional

### Warnings (Mostly Benign)
- 431 warnings, primarily unused code
- Indicates overly broad API surface
- **Impact**: Cluttered build output, but no bugs

### Test Coverage (Adequate for Research)
- Critical paths are tested
- Physics validation included
- **Impact**: Less confidence for edge cases

## Examples

All examples work correctly:

```bash
cargo run --release --example basic_simulation
cargo run --release --example physics_validation
cargo run --release --example phased_array_beamforming
cargo run --release --example plugin_example
cargo run --release --example pstd_fdtd_comparison
cargo run --release --example tissue_model_example
cargo run --release --example wave_simulation
```

## Contributing

Priority improvements that would help:
1. **Reduce warnings** - Remove genuinely unused code
2. **Split large modules** - Improve maintainability
3. **Add more tests** - Increase confidence
4. **Profile performance** - Identify bottlenecks
5. **Simplify plugin system** - Reduce complexity

## Engineering Notes

This library follows a pragmatic approach: **make it work, make it right, make it fast**. Currently, it's at the "make it work" stage with correct physics. The "make it right" (refactoring) and "make it fast" (optimization) stages are future work.

### Design Decisions
- **Broad API** - Provides flexibility at the cost of warnings
- **Plugin architecture** - Extensible but complex
- **Large modules** - Comprehensive but should be split
- **Conservative CFL** - Prioritizes stability over speed

## Summary

**Grade: C** - Functional library with correct physics but technical debt.

This is a working acoustic wave simulation library that produces accurate results. It's suitable for research and development use. The technical debt (warnings, large modules, limited tests) should be addressed for production deployment, but doesn't prevent current usage.

### Bottom Line
- **Does it work?** Yes ✅
- **Is the physics correct?** Yes ✅
- **Can I use it?** Yes, for research/development ✅
- **Is it perfect?** No, but perfect is the enemy of good ⚠️

The code is functional and the physics is validated. Use it, contribute improvements, and help make it better.
