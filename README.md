# Kwavers: Acoustic Wave Simulation Library (Under Development)

⚠️ **WARNING: This project is in early development and is NOT ready for production use** ⚠️

## Current Status

**Build Status**: ❌ FAILING (16 compilation errors)  
**Test Status**: ❌ BROKEN (63+ compilation errors)  
**Code Quality**: ⚠️ POOR (351 warnings)  
**Completion**: ~25%  

## Project Overview

Kwavers aims to be a comprehensive acoustic wave simulation library written in Rust, targeting applications in:
- Medical ultrasound simulation
- Nonlinear acoustics
- Photoacoustic imaging
- Seismic wave propagation

However, the project is currently in a **non-functional state** with significant implementation gaps.

## Critical Issues

### 🔴 Build Failures
- 16 compilation errors preventing any usage
- Method signature mismatches with trait definitions
- FFT function call errors
- Missing error enum variants

### ⚠️ Code Quality Problems
- **351 compiler warnings** including:
  - Unused variables and imports
  - Deprecated function usage
  - Incomplete pattern matching
- **892 C-style for loops** that should use Rust iterators
- **470 functions with underscored parameters** indicating incomplete implementations
- **33 unimplemented sections** with TODO markers

### 📊 Technical Debt
- 20 modules exceeding 500 lines (violating SLAP principle)
- Magic numbers throughout the codebase
- Duplicate implementations violating DRY
- Unnecessary heap allocations instead of zero-copy patterns

## Attempted Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/kwavers/kwavers
cd kwavers

# Attempt to build (WILL FAIL)
cargo build --release
# Error: 16 compilation errors

# Tests do not compile
cargo test
# Error: 63+ compilation errors
```

## Architecture (Planned)

The intended architecture includes:

```
kwavers/
├── src/
│   ├── physics/        # Wave propagation models (partially implemented)
│   ├── solver/         # Numerical solvers (incomplete)
│   ├── medium/         # Material properties (basic structure)
│   ├── gpu/           # GPU acceleration (stubs only)
│   ├── ml/            # Machine learning (not implemented)
│   └── visualization/ # Rendering (not functional)
├── examples/          # Most examples don't compile
└── tests/            # Test suite broken
```

## Features (Intended but Not Working)

### Planned Capabilities
- [ ] Linear and nonlinear acoustic wave propagation
- [ ] FDTD and PSTD solvers
- [ ] Adaptive mesh refinement
- [ ] GPU acceleration
- [ ] Machine learning integration
- [ ] Real-time visualization

### Current Reality
- Basic module structure exists
- Some data structures defined
- No functional simulations possible
- No validated physics implementations
- Zero working test coverage

## Development Status by Component

| Component | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| Core Library | 🔴 Broken | 16 compilation errors |
| Physics Models | 🟡 Incomplete | Unvalidated, untested |
| Numerical Solvers | 🟡 Partial | Basic structure, not functional |
| GPU Support | ⚫ Stubs | Only placeholder code |
| ML Integration | ⚫ None | NotImplemented errors |
| Test Suite | 🔴 Broken | 63+ compilation errors |
| Examples | 🔴 Broken | Most don't compile |
| Documentation | 🟡 Partial | Outdated and incomplete |

## Known Limitations

1. **Cannot perform any simulations** - code doesn't compile
2. **No physics validation** - implementations unverified against literature
3. **No heterogeneous media support** - file loading not implemented
4. **No GPU acceleration** - only stub implementations
5. **No ML capabilities** - returns NotImplemented errors
6. **Poor performance** - 892 inefficient loop patterns
7. **High memory usage** - unnecessary allocations throughout

## Contributing

This project needs significant work before it can accept contributions effectively. Priority areas:

1. **Fix compilation errors** (16 errors blocking everything)
2. **Fix test suite** (63+ errors)
3. **Address warnings** (351 warnings)
4. **Replace C-style loops** (892 instances)
5. **Complete implementations** (470 incomplete functions)
6. **Validate physics** (no current validation)

## Dependencies

```toml
[dependencies]
ndarray = "0.15"
rustfft = "6.1"
rayon = "1.7"
# ... many others
```

## Minimum Requirements

- Rust 1.70+ (for const generics)
- 8GB RAM (when/if it compiles)
- Cannot currently run on any system due to compilation failures

## License

## Disclaimer

**This software is in early development and should not be used for any production, research, or medical applications.** The physics implementations have not been validated, the code doesn't compile, and there is no test coverage. 

## Honest Assessment

This codebase represents an ambitious but incomplete attempt at creating a comprehensive acoustic simulation library. While the architectural vision is sound, the implementation is severely lacking:

- **Actual completion**: ~25% (generous estimate)
- **Time to production ready**: 3-6 months of dedicated development
- **Current usability**: None (doesn't compile)
- **Risk level**: Critical (no validation, no tests, doesn't build)

Potential users should look for alternative, mature acoustic simulation libraries until this project reaches a functional state.
