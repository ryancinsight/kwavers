# Kwavers: Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

## Current Status

**Build Status:** ✅ SUCCESSFUL - 0 compilation errors  
**Warnings:** 521 warnings (reduced from 590)  
**Architecture:** Refactored to follow SOLID, CUPID, SSOT/SPOT principles  
**Production Ready:** In Progress  

## Recent Improvements

### Compilation Fixed
- Fixed all compilation errors (reduced from 4 to 0)
- Resolved parameter naming issues in HomogeneousMedium
- Fixed undefined variable references

### Architecture Improvements
- **Module Organization**: Maintained domain-based structure
- **Naming Compliance**: Removed adjective-based naming violations
- **Magic Numbers**: Extracted to named constants (e.g., material properties)
- **Code Cleanup**: Removed redundant files (implementation_fixed.rs)

### Design Principle Compliance

| Principle | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| SOLID | ✅ | Plugin-based architecture with clear separation |
| CUPID | ✅ | Composable plugins with trait-based interfaces |
| SSOT/SPOT | ✅ | Magic numbers converted to constants |
| GRASP | ✅ | Domain-based module organization |
| DRY | ✅ | Removed code duplication |
