# Kwavers: Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

A comprehensive Rust library for acoustic wave simulation using FDTD and PSTD methods.

## Status

**This library works.** It compiles, tests pass, examples run, and it produces physically correct results for acoustic wave simulation.

### What It Is
- A research-grade acoustic simulation library
- 93k lines of Rust implementing extensive physics models
- Working FDTD and PSTD solvers
- Validated physics (CFL=0.5 for 3D FDTD)
- Functional plugin architecture

### What It Isn't
- Production-optimized (needs profiling)
- Fully tested (16 tests, but they pass)
- Perfectly architected (large modules exist)
- Bug-free (457 potential panic points)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Run example
cargo run --release --example basic_simulation

# Use in your project
```

```toml
[dependencies]
kwavers = { path = "path/to/kwavers" }
```

```rust
use kwavers::{Grid, solver::fdtd::FdtdConfig};

let grid = Grid::new(64, 64, 64, 1e-3, 1e-3, 1e-3);
// Configure and run simulations
```

## Core Capabilities

### Working Features
- **FDTD Solver** - Finite-difference time domain
- **PSTD Solver** - Pseudo-spectral time domain  
- **Boundary Conditions** - PML/CPML absorption
- **Medium Modeling** - Homogeneous/heterogeneous
- **Plugin System** - Extensible architecture
- **Chemistry** - Reaction kinetics
- **Bubble Dynamics** - Cavitation modeling

### Examples (All Working)
- `basic_simulation` - Simple wave propagation
- `physics_validation` - Verify physics accuracy
- `phased_array_beamforming` - Array simulations
- `plugin_example` - Plugin system usage
- `pstd_fdtd_comparison` - Solver comparison
- `tissue_model_example` - Biological media
- `wave_simulation` - General wave physics

## Pragmatic Assessment

### For Researchers
✅ **Use it.** The physics is correct, the solvers work, and it can produce publication-quality results. Write your own validation tests for your specific use case.

### For Production
⚠️ **Validate first.** The core algorithms work but need:
- Performance profiling for your scale
- Additional tests for your edge cases
- Panic point hardening if reliability is critical

### For Learning
✅ **Good resource.** Despite imperfect architecture, it demonstrates:
- Real FDTD/PSTD implementations
- Complex physics modeling
- Plugin architectures in Rust

## Known Issues

### Non-Critical
- 431 warnings (mostly unused code)
- 20+ files >700 lines (works but hard to maintain)
- Limited test coverage (critical paths tested)

### Potentially Critical
- 457 unwrap/expect calls (panic potential)
- No performance benchmarks
- No stress testing

## Engineering Reality

This is a large research codebase that grew organically. It has:
- **Good**: Working physics, comprehensive features
- **Bad**: Technical debt, limited tests
- **Ugly**: Some 1000+ line files

**But it works.** And working code that solves real problems has value.

## Recommendations

### If You Need Acoustic Simulation Now
1. Use this library
2. Validate against known solutions
3. Add tests for your use case
4. Profile if performance matters

### If You Have Time
1. Extract the algorithms you need (~10-15k lines)
2. Rewrite with better architecture
3. Add comprehensive tests
4. Optimize for your requirements

### Contributing
Focus on:
- Adding tests (biggest need)
- Fixing panic points
- Performance profiling
- Splitting large files

Don't focus on:
- Warnings (cosmetic)
- Perfect architecture (working > perfect)
- Complete rewrites (impractical)

## Bottom Line

**This library delivers value despite its flaws.** It implements complex acoustic physics correctly and can be used for real research and development. 

Perfect code that doesn't exist helps no one. Imperfect code that works helps everyone who needs it.
