  - `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES_REVIEW.md`
  - `COMPREHENSIVE_IMPROVEMENT_SUMMARY.md`

### 6. Design Principles Application ✅
- Verified adherence to:
  - SOLID principles
  - CUPID principles
  - GRASP principles
  - Additional principles (DRY, KISS, YAGNI, SSOT, Clean, ACID)
- Created comprehensive review: `DESIGN_PRINCIPLES_REVIEW.md`

### 7. Build Environment Setup ✅
- Installed required dependencies:
  - Rust nightly toolchain
  - OpenSSL development libraries
  - HDF5 development libraries
  - Fontconfig development libraries

### 8. Build Issues Identified ✅
- Identified compatibility issues:
  - Candle-core incompatibility with rand 0.8.5
