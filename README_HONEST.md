# Kwavers: Acoustic Simulation Library - Honest Status Report

## ⚠️ CRITICAL: Non-Functional Codebase

**Build Status:** ❌ 187 compilation errors  
**Functionality:** 0% operational  
**Production Ready:** NO  

## Actual State

This codebase is currently **non-functional** with fundamental architectural issues:

- **187 compilation errors** preventing any functionality
- **Incomplete implementations** throughout (18+ TODOs/FIXMEs)
- **Missing core components** (HomogeneousMedium was missing entirely)
- **Architectural violations** (files with 1000+ lines, God objects)
- **No working physics simulations**
- **No passing tests** (cannot compile to test)

## What Was Claimed vs Reality

| Claimed | Reality |
|---------|---------|
| "100% Complete" | Cannot compile |
| "Production Ready" | 187 errors |
| "All physics implemented" | Mostly stubs |
| "Clean architecture" | God objects, 1000+ line files |
| "Validated algorithms" | Cannot run to validate |

## Required to Make Functional

1. Fix 187 compilation errors
2. Implement 50+ missing methods
3. Complete stub implementations
4. Restructure oversized modules
5. Add actual physics implementations
6. Validate against literature

## Honest Timeline

- **Making it compile:** 2-3 weeks
- **Basic functionality:** 2-3 months  
- **Production ready:** 6-12 months
- **Full feature set:** 1-2 years

## Recommendation

This project needs a complete architectural overhaul. Consider:
- Starting fresh with a minimal working example
- Building incrementally with tests
- Following SOLID principles from the start
- Validating each physics module against literature

The current codebase is technical debt.
