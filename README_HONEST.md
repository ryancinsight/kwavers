# Kwavers - Acoustic Wave Simulation Library

## The Truth

This codebase is **partially complete**. It compiles, examples run, but significant portions are unimplemented stubs.

### Current State

- **Warnings:** 499 (down from 531)
- **Incomplete Implementations:** ~104 placeholders
- **Test Coverage:** Minimal, relies on mocks
- **Performance:** Suboptimal due to array cloning
- **Architecture:** Good foundation, poor execution

### What Works

1. **FDTD Solver** - Basic implementation, validated CFL condition
2. **PSTD Solver** - Spectral methods framework present
3. **Medium Models** - Homogeneous and heterogeneous support
4. **Plugin Architecture** - Well-designed, underutilized

### What Doesn't

1. **Hybrid Solver** - Stub implementation only
2. **GPU Support** - Framework only, no kernels
3. **ML Integration** - Empty modules
4. **AMR (Adaptive Mesh Refinement)** - Incomplete
5. **Optimization** - No SIMD, excessive cloning

### Critical Issues

1. **Array Cloning** - Every timestep clones entire 3D fields
2. **Unused Code** - 191 unused variables indicate incomplete logic
3. **Mock Testing** - Tests use mocks instead of real implementations
4. **Magic Numbers** - Scattered throughout despite constants module

### Performance Profile

```
Bottlenecks:
- Array3::clone() in hot paths: O(nÂ³) overhead
- No parallelization in critical loops
- Missing SIMD vectorization
- Excessive heap allocations
```

### Required for Production

1. **Complete ALL stub implementations**
2. **Eliminate array cloning** - implement proper borrowing
3. **Add SIMD** - at minimum for Laplacian operations
4. **Remove mocks** - test with real implementations
5. **Validate physics** - against k-Wave or similar

### Honest Assessment

This is a **research prototype**, not production software. The architecture is sound, but implementation is incomplete. Approximately 30% of promised functionality is missing or stubbed.

**Grade: C+** - Architecturally competent, executionally deficient.

## Usage Warning

Do NOT use for:
- Medical applications
- Safety-critical systems
- Published research without validation
- Performance benchmarks

## Contributing

Before contributing:
1. Complete existing stubs before adding features
2. No more mocks - use real implementations
3. Zero tolerance for new warnings
4. Benchmark against k-Wave for validation
