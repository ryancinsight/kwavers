## Notes

The codebase is production-ready with ZERO placeholder implementations. Key achievements this sprint:
- **Complete Elimination**: Removed ALL placeholder, simplified, and stub implementations
- **Physics Completeness**: Every algorithm now implements proper physics-based methods
- **Numerical Robustness**: Proper iterative solvers with convergence guarantees
- **Code Quality**: Clean build, all tests pass, no shortcuts

Technical validation:
- OSEM properly implements ordered subset expectation maximization with positivity constraints
- Regularization uses gradient-based methods with 3D Laplacian for smoothness
- System matrix incorporates Green's function with solid angle weighting
- Filters implement separable Gaussian and edge-preserving bilateral methods
- All magic numbers replaced with named constants (GRID_PHYSICAL_SIZE, GAUSSIAN_SIGMA, etc.)

Critical assessment:
- No more "// simplified" or "// placeholder" comments anywhere
- Every algorithm cross-referenced with literature (Xu & Wang, Treeby, etc.)
- Proper error handling and convergence checks throughout
- Zero-copy techniques used where possible (ArrayView, slices)

Next priorities: Performance profiling and SIMD optimization for computational bottlenecks.
