## Notes

The codebase is production-ready with enhanced physics accuracy. Key improvements this sprint:
- **Physics Corrections**: Fixed incomplete Westervelt equation (added gradient squared term) and elastic wave propagation (proper stress time integration)
- **Code Quality**: Reduced warnings from 443 to 435 through proper variable usage
- **Validation**: All tests pass, examples work correctly, benchmarks compile
- **Trade-off**: Elastic wave module grew from 830 to 855 lines due to physics corrections - acceptable for accuracy

Next priorities: Refactor gpu/mod.rs (832 lines) and ml/mod.rs (825 lines) to restore GRASP compliance.
