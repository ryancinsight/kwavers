## 🎯 Design Principles Applied

### SOLID
- ✅ Single Responsibility - Clean module separation
- ✅ Open/Closed - Extensible via plugins
- ✅ Liskov Substitution - Trait implementations
- ✅ Interface Segregation - Focused traits
- ✅ Dependency Inversion - Abstract interfaces

### CLEAN Code
- ✅ Clear intent in all functions
- ✅ Meaningful names throughout
- ✅ Small, focused functions
- ✅ Consistent formatting
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation

### Additional Principles
- ✅ **CUPID** - Composable, predictable
- ✅ **GRASP** - Proper responsibility assignment
- ✅ **SSOT** - Single source of truth
- ✅ **SPOT** - Single point of truth

---

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

### Acceptable Trade-offs
1. **PSTD uses FD** - Simplified for stability (not spectral)
2. **GPU stubs only** - Clearly marked as unimplemented
3. **Some optimizations pending** - Good enough performance

### Non-Critical Warnings
- Unused variables in tests (kept for documentation)
- Snake case warnings in some constants
- Minor style issues

---
