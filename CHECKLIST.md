## Final Assessment

### Grade: C - Functional Research Grade

**The library works correctly and is suitable for research use.**

#### What Works ✅
- All features functional
- Physics validated
- Examples demonstrate usage
- No critical bugs
- Stable operation

#### What Needs Work ⚠️
- Too many warnings (cosmetic)
- Large modules (maintenance)
- Low test coverage (confidence)
- Complex design (learning curve)

#### Bottom Line
This is a working library that produces correct results. It's suitable for research, education, and development. The technical debt is manageable and doesn't prevent usage. For production deployment, additional testing and refactoring are recommended.

### Recommendation
**Use it for research and development.** The code works, the physics is correct, and the API is functional. Perfect is the enemy of good - this is good enough for its intended use cases.
