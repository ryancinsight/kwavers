# Kwavers Development Checklist

## Current Status: B+ (Good Quality, Needs Refinement)

**Version**: 2.15.0  
**Tests**: 16/16 Passing  
**Build**: Clean  
**Review Date**: Current Session  

---

## ✅ Working Components

### Build & Compilation
- ✅ **Zero Errors** - Clean compilation
- ✅ **No Critical Warnings** - Removed blanket suppressions
- ✅ **All Examples Build** - 30 examples compile (excessive)
- ✅ **Release Optimized** - Production builds work

### Test Coverage  
- ✅ **Integration Tests**: 5/5 passing
- ✅ **Solver Tests**: 3/3 passing
- ✅ **Comparison Tests**: 3/3 passing
- ✅ **Doc Tests**: 5/5 passing
- ✅ **Total**: 16/16 (100%)

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **FDTD Solver** - Correct Yee scheme implementation
- ✅ **PSTD Solver** - Working (uses FD, not spectral)
- ✅ **Plugin System** - Functional but complex
- ✅ **Grid Management** - Well structured
- ✅ **Boundary Conditions** - PML/CPML working
- ✅ **Physics Models** - Validated against literature

## ⚠️ Issues Identified

### Code Organization (Priority: High)
- ❌ **8 files > 900 lines** - Need splitting:
  - solver/fdtd/mod.rs (1138 lines)
  - source/flexible_transducer.rs (1097 lines)
  - physics/chemistry/mod.rs (964 lines - partially addressed)
  - Others...
- ❌ **369 source files** - Excessive for project scope
- ❌ **30 examples** - Should be 5-10 focused demos

### Technical Debt (Priority: Medium)
- ⚠️ **4 TODO comments** - Unfinished implementations
- ⚠️ **Underscored variables** - Possible dead code
- ⚠️ **Magic numbers** - Not all constants named
- ⚠️ **Test duplication** - Some repeated test code

### Design Issues (Priority: Medium)
- ⚠️ **SRP violations** - Large modules with multiple responsibilities
- ⚠️ **Complex abstractions** - Over-engineered in places
- ⚠️ **Missing CI/CD** - No automated testing pipeline

## 📊 Quality Metrics

| Category | Grade | Notes |
|----------|-------|-------|
| **Correctness** | A- | Physics validated, tests pass |
| **Organization** | C+ | Large modules, too many files |
| **Documentation** | B+ | Good but some redundancy |
| **Design Patterns** | B | SOLID partially violated |
| **Maintainability** | B- | Needs refactoring |
| **Performance** | B | Not fully optimized |
| **Overall** | B+ | Functional but needs cleanup |

## 📈 Progress Tracking

### Refactoring Progress
- Chemistry module: ✅ Split (998 → 3 files)
- FDTD module: ❌ Pending (1138 lines)
- Flexible transducer: ❌ Pending (1097 lines)
- Other large modules: ❌ Pending

### Documentation Cleanup

## 🏁 Definition of Done

A component is considered "done" when:
1. No files exceed 500 lines
2. All magic numbers are named constants
3. No TODO/FIXME comments remain
4. No underscored unused variables
5. Full test coverage for public APIs
6. Documentation is complete and accurate
7. Follows SOLID principles
8. No clippy warnings

---

## 📝 Notes

### What's Working Well
- Core physics implementations are solid
- Test coverage is good for main paths
- Error handling is comprehensive
- Documentation includes literature references

### What Needs Improvement
- Module organization and size
- Reduce complexity and over-engineering
- Consolidate examples
- Add automated quality checks

### Recommendations
1. **Use the library** with awareness of current limitations
2. **Prioritize refactoring** of large modules
3. **Contribute** to addressing technical debt
4. **Profile performance** before optimization
