## Known Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è

### High Priority (Affects Reliability)
- [ ] **457 panic points** - unwrap/expect calls that could crash
- [ ] **No performance data** - Unknown bottlenecks
- [ ] **Limited tests** - Only 16 for 337 files

### Medium Priority (Affects Maintainability)  
- [ ] **20+ large files** - Some >1000 lines
- [ ] **431 warnings** - Mostly unused code
- [ ] **No benchmarks** - Performance unknown

### Low Priority (Cosmetic)
- [ ] **Code organization** - Could be better structured
- [ ] **Documentation gaps** - Some areas undocumented
- [ ] **Naming inconsistencies** - Minor issues

## For Users

### To Use Successfully ‚úÖ
1. **Validate results** - Compare with known solutions
2. **Add your tests** - Cover your specific use cases
3. **Handle errors** - Wrap calls to prevent panics
4. **Profile if needed** - Measure performance for your scale

### Risk Mitigation
| Risk | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|-------------------|
| Panic points | Validate all inputs before calling |
| Performance | Profile and optimize hot paths |
| Edge cases | Test thoroughly for your scenario |
| Large scale | Benchmark at target scale first |

## For Contributors

### High Value Tasks üéØ
1. **Add tests** - Biggest need, immediate value
2. **Fix panic points** - Replace unwrap with proper errors
3. **Profile performance** - Identify bottlenecks
4. **Document usage** - Help other users
5. **Add examples** - Show more use cases

### Medium Value Tasks
1. **Split large files** - Improve maintainability
2. **Reduce warnings** - Clean up unused code
3. **Add benchmarks** - Measure performance

### Low Value Tasks
1. **Perfect architecture** - Working > perfect
2. **Fix all warnings** - Many are cosmetic
3. **Complete rewrite** - Impractical

## Decision Guide

### Should I Use This Library?

**YES if:**
- ‚úÖ You need acoustic simulation
- ‚úÖ You can validate results
- ‚úÖ You'll add tests for your case
- ‚úÖ You accept current limitations

**NO if:**
- ‚ùå You need guaranteed reliability
- ‚ùå You can't handle potential panics
- ‚ùå You need perfect code
- ‚ùå You won't validate results

**MAYBE if:**
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You have time to improve it
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You can extract what you need
- ‚ö†Ô∏è You'll contribute improvements

## Action Plan

### Week 1 (Critical)
- [ ] Identify panic points in your code path
- [ ] Add tests for your use case
- [ ] Validate against known solutions
- [ ] Profile if performance matters

### Month 1 (Important)
- [ ] Fix panics in your code path
- [ ] Add integration tests
- [ ] Document your usage
- [ ] Share improvements

### Ongoing (Valuable)
- [ ] Add more tests
- [ ] Fix more panic points
- [ ] Improve documentation
- [ ] Refactor large files

## Bottom Line

**This library works and delivers value.**

It's not perfect, but it successfully implements complex acoustic physics and can be used for real work. Focus on:

1. **Using it** for what it does well
2. **Improving it** incrementally
3. **Contributing back** improvements
4. **Being pragmatic** about its limitations

Perfect is the enemy of good. This is good enough to be useful.
