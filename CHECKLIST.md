## Production Readiness: Conditional ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Current State
- **Functional**: Yes ‚úÖ
- **Stable**: Yes ‚úÖ
- **Performant**: Unknown ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Maintainable**: Challenging ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Documented**: Basic ‚ö†Ô∏è

### Recommendation
The library is functional and suitable for research and development use. For production deployment:
