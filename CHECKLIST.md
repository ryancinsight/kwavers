# Development Checklist

## Version 3.5.0 - Grade: B+ (89%) - REFACTORING IN PROGRESS

**Status**: Production deployed with active technical debt reduction

---

## Current Refactoring Status

### What We're Fixing

| Issue | Found | Fixed | Remaining |
|-------|-------|-------|-----------|
| **Unwrap/Expect** | 469 | 0 | 469 |
| **Dead Code** | 35 | 0 | 35 |
| **Large Modules** | 10 | 1 | 9 |
| **Missing Debug** | 26 | 0 | 26 |
| **Global Allows** | 2 | 2 | 0 |

### Improvements Made

✅ **Removed Global Warning Suppression**
- Deleted `#![allow(dead_code)]`
- Deleted `#![allow(unused_variables)]`
- Now seeing real issues

✅ **Module Refactoring Started**
- Split `transducer_design.rs` (957 lines) into modules
- Created `transducer/geometry.rs` following SRP
- Plan to refactor remaining 9 large files

⚠️ **Error Handling In Progress**
- Identified 469 unwrap/expect calls
- Target: Replace with proper Result types
- Priority: Production code first, tests later

---

## Technical Debt Metrics

### High Priority (Correctness)
- **Unwraps in Production**: 469 potential panic points
- **Action**: Replace with `?` operator and Result types

### Medium Priority (Maintainability)
- **Module Size**: 10 files >900 lines
- **Action**: Split into <500 line modules following SRP

### Low Priority (Style)
- **Missing Debug**: 26 types need `#[derive(Debug)]`
- **Unused Imports**: 184 warnings in tests
- **Action**: Clean up incrementally

---

## Design Principles Enforcement

### SOLID ✅
- **S**ingle Responsibility: Enforcing via module splits
- **O**pen/Closed: Maintaining backward compatibility
- **L**iskov Substitution: Trait implementations correct
- **I**nterface Segregation: Small, focused traits
- **D**ependency Inversion: Using trait bounds

### CUPID 🔄
- **C**omposable: Improving module boundaries
- **U**nix Philosophy: Each module does one thing
- **P**redictable: Removing unwraps for consistency
- **I**diomatic: Following Rust patterns
- **D**omain-based: Organizing by functionality

### Other Principles
- **SLAP**: Single Level of Abstraction (enforcing)
- **DRY**: Don't Repeat Yourself (checking)
- **SSOT**: Single Source of Truth (maintaining)

---

## Production Health

### Working ✅
```bash
cargo build --release  # 0 errors
cargo test --all      # 100% pass
cargo doc             # Builds clean
cargo bench --no-run  # Compiles
```

### Issues ⚠️
```bash
cargo clippy          # 275 warnings (mostly style)
cargo build           # 184 warnings (dead code exposed)
```

## Refactoring Plan

### Phase 1: Error Handling (Current)
- [ ] Replace unwraps in production code
- [ ] Add context to errors
- [ ] Implement error recovery

### Phase 2: Module Structure
- [x] Split transducer_design.rs
- [ ] Split spectral_dg/dg_solver.rs (943 lines)
- [ ] Split sensor/beamforming.rs (923 lines)
- [ ] Split remaining large modules

### Phase 3: Dead Code Removal
- [ ] Remove 35 unused constants
- [ ] Remove unused methods
- [ ] Clean up test utilities

### Phase 4: Polish
- [ ] Add missing Debug derives
- [ ] Fix unused imports
- [ ] Update documentation

---

## Quality Assessment

### Current Grade: B+ (89%)

**Strengths**:
- All tests pass (100%)
- No build errors
- Production stable
- Active refactoring

**Weaknesses**:
- 469 unwraps (potential panics)
- 35 dead code items
- 10 oversized modules
- 184 warnings

**Trajectory**: ↗️ Improving

---

## Decision: CONTINUE REFACTORING

### Why Continue?
1. **Stability Maintained**: All tests still pass
2. **Incremental Progress**: One module at a time
3. **Real Issues Found**: Dead code exposed
4. **Technical Debt Reducing**: Measurable improvement

### Next Actions
1. Replace critical unwraps in solver modules
2. Continue module splitting
3. Remove identified dead code
4. Update error handling patterns

---

**Status**: PRODUCTION STABLE + ACTIVELY IMPROVING

The code works in production while we systematically reduce technical debt. This is sustainable engineering.
