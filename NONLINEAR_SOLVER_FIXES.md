# Nonlinear Acoustic Solver Fixes

**Date**: January 2025  
**Status**: ✅ All Critical Issues Resolved

## Executive Summary

Successfully addressed all four critical issues with the nonlinear acoustic solvers, resulting in:
- Clear separation between Westervelt and Kuznetsov implementations
- Correct physics implementation for acoustic diffusivity
- Consistent time-stepping schemes
- Improved shock-capturing methods

## Issues Resolved

### Issue #1: Redundant and Conflicting Nonlinear Solvers ✅

**Problem**: Two separate implementations for nonlinear wave propagation with overlapping functionality.

**Solution**:
- Refactored `core.rs` to be a pure Westervelt equation solver
- Removed all Kuznetsov-related code from `core.rs`
- Made `kuznetsov.rs` the single authoritative implementation of the Kuznetsov equation
- Clear separation of concerns between the two solvers

**Changes Made**:
- Removed `use_kuznetsov_terms`, `enable_diffusivity`, and `pressure_history` fields from `NonlinearWave`
- Deleted `compute_kuznetsov_nonlinear_terms()` and `compute_diffusivity_term()` methods from `core.rs`
- Updated documentation to clearly indicate Westervelt equation implementation

### Issue #2: Incorrect Acoustic Diffusivity in Kuznetsov Solver ✅

**Problem**: The `compute_diffusivity_term` was implementing simple thermal diffusion `α∇²p` instead of the correct third-order time derivative `-(δ/c₀⁴)∂³p/∂t³`.

**Solution**:
- Replaced incorrect implementation with proper third-order time derivative
- Uses backward difference formula for `∂³p/∂t³`
- Correctly applies the `-(δ/c₀⁴)` coefficient

**Implementation**:
```rust
// Correct third-order finite difference
let dt_cubed = dt * dt * dt;
let d3p_dt3 = (pressure - 3.0 * p_prev + 3.0 * p_prev2 - p_prev3) / dt_cubed;

// Apply correct coefficient
let c0_4 = c0 * c0 * c0 * c0;
*val = -(delta / c0_4) * d3p;
```

### Issue #3: Inconsistent Time-Stepping in Kuznetsov Solver ✅

**Problem**: Solver configured with RK4 but using hardcoded second-order central difference.

**Solution**:
- Implemented proper time integration scheme selection
- Added support for multiple schemes:
  - RK4 (4th-order Runge-Kutta)
  - RK2 (2nd-order Runge-Kutta)
  - Adams-Bashforth (3rd order)
  - Leap-Frog (2nd order, energy conserving)
  - Euler (1st order, for testing)
- Each scheme properly implemented with consistent numerical formulation

**Key Changes**:
- Added `update_with_rk4()`, `update_with_leapfrog()`, `update_with_euler()`, `update_with_adams_bashforth()`
- Created `compute_pressure_derivative()` for first-order formulations
- Proper scheme selection based on configuration

### Issue #4: Potentially Artifact-Inducing Stability Mechanisms ✅

**Problem**: Gradient clamping suppresses physical shock formation and introduces artifacts.

**Solution**:
- Made gradient clamping configurable with clear warnings
- Added shock detection mechanism based on normalized pressure gradients
- Implemented artificial viscosity as alternative stabilization method
- Added proper documentation about the limitations

**New Features**:
- `set_gradient_clamping()` with warnings about artifacts
- `detect_shock_regions()` for identifying shock formation
- `apply_artificial_viscosity()` using Von Neumann-Richtmyer approach
- Clear warnings when gradient clamping is enabled

## Code Quality Improvements

### Documentation
- Added comprehensive warnings about gradient clamping limitations
- Clear indication of which equation each solver implements
- Literature references for numerical methods

### Design Principles
- **Single Responsibility**: Each solver handles one equation
- **Open/Closed**: Extensible through configuration, not modification
- **DRY**: No duplicate implementations
- **YAGNI**: Removed unused Kuznetsov code from Westervelt solver

### Numerical Stability
- Proper CFL condition checking
- Configurable stability mechanisms
- Better handling of edge cases

## Testing Recommendations

1. **Verify Kuznetsov Diffusivity**:
   - Test with known analytical solutions for thermoviscous losses
   - Compare with published results for acoustic diffusivity

2. **Time Integration Validation**:
   - Compare RK4 vs Leap-Frog for energy conservation
   - Verify convergence rates for different schemes

3. **Shock Capturing**:
   - Test with Riemann problems
   - Compare gradient clamping vs artificial viscosity

4. **Performance**:
   - Benchmark different time integration schemes
   - Profile shock detection overhead

## Future Improvements

1. **Advanced Shock Capturing**:
   - Implement WENO limiters
   - Add hybrid spectral-DG methods
   - Adaptive artificial viscosity

2. **Optimization**:
   - SIMD optimization for RK4 stages
   - Parallel shock detection
   - Cache-friendly memory access patterns

3. **Validation**:
   - Comprehensive test suite against analytical solutions
   - Comparison with established codes (k-Wave, etc.)

- ✅ Clear separation between Westervelt and Kuznetsov solvers
