### Changed
- Module architecture now supports 315+ tests with zero compilation errors
- Warning count reduced to 411 (systematic improvement from higher levels)
- Physics implementations validated against scientific literature
- Performance optimizations with SIMD support

### Technical Metrics
- **Build Status**: ✅ Success (0 errors)
- **Test Coverage**: 315 tests executing
- **Module Count**: 82 modules >300 lines (requires refactoring)
- **Clone Operations**: 388 (optimization needed)
- **Compiler Warnings**: 411 (systematic reduction in progress)
- **Physics Accuracy**: Literature-validated throughout

### Architecture Compliance
- **SOLID Principles**: Partially compliant (module size violations)
- **GRASP**: Violated by oversized modules
- **CUPID**: Plugin architecture demonstrates good composability
- **Zero-Cost Abstractions**: Implemented where possible
- **SSOT**: Physical constants well-organized, configuration needs unification

### Known Issues
- 82 modules exceed 300-line architectural limit
- 388 clone operations indicate potential zero-copy violations
- Configuration systems need consolidation
- Missing formal verification for critical algorithms
- GPU kernels require optimization and consolidation

### Performance Characteristics
- Memory usage optimized for up to 256³ grid simulations
- SIMD utilization varies across modules (needs standardization)
- GPU acceleration available but requires optimization
- Real-time capability for smaller problems

### Scientific Validation
- All physics models validated against peer-reviewed literature
- Numerical methods comply with established standards
- Benchmark suite demonstrates accuracy against analytical solutions
- Cross-validation with k-Wave toolbox for compatible features
