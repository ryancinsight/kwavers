# Critical Fixes Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Issues Fixed**: 3 critical implementation errors

## 1. Anisotropic Rotation - Bond Transformation ✅

### Problem
The `rotate` function in `StiffnessTensor` was a placeholder that simply cloned the tensor without applying any rotation. This caused the `muscle` function to ignore fiber angles completely.

### Solution
Implemented full 6x6 Bond transformation matrix:
- Proper 3x3 rotation matrix from Euler angles (ZYX convention)
- Complete Bond matrix construction for Voigt notation
- Matrix multiplication: C' = M^T C M
- Added test to verify rotation behavior

### Impact
- Muscle fiber orientation now correctly affects wave propagation
- Anisotropic materials can be properly oriented in 3D space
- Validated with 90° rotation test

## 2. Fractional Derivative Absorption ✅

### Problem
The frequency-domain absorption implementation was convoluted and incorrect:
- Used `k_mag^(2y-2)` instead of proper power law
- Mixed fractional Laplacian concepts with absorption
- Missing sound speed parameter

### Solution
Corrected to proper power law implementation:
- Direct calculation: `α(f) = α₀ * (f/f_ref)^y`
- Attenuation: `exp(-α(f) * c₀ * dt)`
- Added `c0` parameter for sound speed
- Added comprehensive test with expected values

### Impact
- Accurate frequency-dependent absorption for tissues
- Correct power law behavior validated
- Matches literature (Szabo, 1994)

## 3. Conservation Monitor - Parameterized Gamma ✅

### Problem
The conservation monitor hardcoded γ = 1.4 (air) for all media, leading to incorrect energy calculations for liquids and tissues.

### Solution
Parameterized gamma:
- Added `gamma` field to `ConservationMonitor`
- Created `with_gamma` constructor
- Added `gamma_for_medium` helper with values:
  - Air: 1.4
  - Water: 7.15 (Tait equation)
  - Tissue: 4.0
  - Helium: 1.66
  - Argon: 1.67
- Added `configure_for_medium` to `MultiRateTimeIntegrator`

### Impact
- Accurate energy conservation for different media
- Proper equation of state for liquids
- Validated with test showing different energies for same pressure

## Testing

All fixes include comprehensive tests:
- Anisotropic rotation: Validates 90° rotation and symmetry
- Fractional absorption: Verifies power law and decay rates
- Conservation gamma: Confirms different energy calculations

## Conclusion

These fixes ensure:
1. Anisotropic materials work correctly with arbitrary orientations
2. Tissue absorption follows proper frequency power laws
3. Conservation monitoring is accurate for all media types

The implementations now match their theoretical foundations and literature references.
