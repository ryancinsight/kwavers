## Current Priorities

### High Priority (P0) - Critical Path
1. **Benchmark Infrastructure Configuration**: 30min
   - Configure Cargo.toml with [[bench]] sections
   - Enable criterion benchmark execution
   - Required for: Performance baseline tracking
   - Impact: HIGH - Unblocks data-driven optimization

2. **Performance Baseline Execution**: 30min
   - Run criterion benchmarks for FDTD derivatives (9 variants)
   - Run criterion benchmarks for k-space operators (4 grid sizes)
   - Run criterion benchmarks for grid/medium/field operations
   - Document baseline metrics
   - Impact: HIGH - Enables optimization decisions

### Standard Priority (P1) - Important
3. **Remaining Test Failures Investigation**: 1-2h
   - Triage 11 documented failures (Keller-Miksis, k-Wave benchmarks)
   - Categorize: physics bugs vs validation tolerance issues
   - Create targeted fixes or document as known limitations
   - Impact: HIGH - Path to 100% test coverage

4. **Property Test Expansion**: 2-3h
   - Add proptest for FDTD time-stepping invariants (CFL condition)
   - Add proptest for source/sensor geometry validation
   - Add proptest for boundary condition consistency
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Enhanced edge case coverage

5. **Clone Optimization Review**: 2-3h
   - Review 406 clone instances for unnecessary allocations
   - Focus on hot paths identified by profiling
   - Replace with views/borrows where appropriate
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Performance optimization

6. **Module Size Compliance**: 2-4h
   - Refactor 27 files exceeding 400-line limit
   - Apply GRASP principles for extraction
   - Maintain functional cohesion
   - Impact: MEDIUM - Architecture quality
