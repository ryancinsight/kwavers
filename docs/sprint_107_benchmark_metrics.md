harness = false

[[bench]]
name = "critical_path_benchmarks"
harness = false

[[bench]]
name = "grid_benchmarks"
harness = false

[[bench]]
name = "physics_benchmarks"
harness = false

[[bench]]
name = "cpml_benchmark"

## Baseline Performance Metrics

### Grid Operations (grid_benchmarks.rs)

| Operation | Time (ns) | Confidence Interval |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| grid_dimensions | 1.56 ns | ±0.01 ns |
| grid_spacing | 1.74 ns | ±0.01 ns |

**Analysis**: Sub-2ns access times demonstrate zero-cost abstraction for grid properties.

### Performance Baseline (performance_baseline.rs)

#### Grid Creation (Size-Invariant)

| Size | Time (ns) | Confidence Interval |
|------|-----------|---------------------|
| 32³ | 16.92 ns | ±0.03 ns |
| 64³ | 16.92 ns | ±0.03 ns |
| 128³ | 16.92 ns | ±0.03 ns |

**Analysis**: Size-invariant creation time indicates efficient metadata-only initialization (no allocation at construction).

#### Field Creation (Memory Allocation)

| Size | Voxels | Time (µs) | Confidence Interval |
|------|--------|-----------|---------------------|
| 32³ | 32,768 | 2.95 µs | ±0.03 µs |
| 64³ | 262,144 | 31.61 µs | ±0.03 µs |
| 128³ | 2,097,152 | 222.73 µs | ±10.36 µs |

**Analysis**: Scales with O(n³) as expected for volume allocation.

#### Field Operations (64³ Grid)

| Operation | Time (µs) | Confidence Interval |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| field_add_64 | 79.54 µs | ±2.04 µs |
| field_mul_64 | 54.44 µs | ±2.96 µs |

**Analysis**: Multiplication faster than addition due to simpler operation.

#### Medium Property Lookups

| Operation | Time (ns) | Confidence Interval |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| density_lookup | 1.24 ns | ±0.00 ns |
| sound_speed_lookup | 1.24 ns | ±0.00 ns |

**Analysis**: Sub-2ns lookup demonstrates zero-cost abstraction for homogeneous medium.

#### Spatial Indexing

| Operation | Time (ns) | Confidence Interval |
|-----------|-----------|---------------------|
| position_to_indices | 10.03 ns | ±0.02 ns |

**Analysis**: 10ns coordinate transform is acceptable overhead.

### Critical Path Operations (critical_path_benchmarks.rs)

#### FDTD Derivative Computation

| Order | Size | Time | Analysis |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| 2nd | 32³ | 94.21 µs | Baseline 2nd-order accuracy |
| 2nd | 64³ | 835.31 µs | 8.86× scaling (vs 8× theoretical) |
| 2nd | 128³ | 7.18 ms | 8.60× scaling (good) |
| 4th | 32³ | 95.18 µs | +1% vs 2nd order (acceptable overhead) |
| 4th | 64³ | 1.19 ms | 1.42× vs 2nd order (higher accuracy cost) |
| 4th | 128³ | 9.09 ms | 1.27× vs 2nd order |
| 6th | 32³ | 102.47 µs | +7.6% vs 4th order |
| 6th | 64³ | 1.24 ms | +4.2% vs 4th order |
| 6th | 128³ | 10.78 ms | +18.6% vs 4th order |

**Key Insights**:
- Good scaling efficiency (8-9× per dimension doubling)
- Higher-order methods show acceptable overhead (+7-19%)
- 128³ grids complete in ~10ms (100 Hz update rate achievable)

#### K-Space Operator Computation

| Size | Voxels | Time | Throughput |
|------|--------|------|------------|
| 32³ | 32,768 | 260.06 ns | 126 Gvoxel/s |
| 64³ | 262,144 | (not shown) | - |
| 128³ | 2,097,152 | (not shown) | - |

**Analysis**: Sub-microsecond wavenumber computation demonstrates efficient spectral operations.
