### 🔴 REMAINING CRITICAL PRIORITIES (≤3 per framework requirements)
1. **SRS NFR-002 VIOLATION**: Test suite exceeds 30s limit (critical production blocker)
   - **Evidence**: Full test suite times out at 30s due to build overhead  
   - **Solution**: Implement test pre-compilation + integration test optimization
   - **Priority**: P0 - Blocks production deployment

2. **TEST ARCHITECTURE OPTIMIZATION**: Split fast/slow test execution  
   - **Evidence**: Individual tests fast (<1s) but collective execution exceeds limits
   - **Solution**: Separate unit tests (CI) vs integration tests (nightly)  
   - **Priority**: P1 - Production efficiency

3. **INTEGRATION TEST COMPUTATIONAL COMPLEXITY**: Large physics simulations need optimization
   - **Evidence**: Multiple 10K+ line validation tests with complex solver operations
