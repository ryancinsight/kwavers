# Development Status Checklist - Kwavers Physics Simulation Library

## Current Development Phase: **Mid-development: Core solvers implemented, optimization and restructuring needed**

## Codebase State Assessment

### Architecture Analysis
**Current Status:** Mid-development with substantial physics implementations but architectural violations requiring systematic refactoring.

The codebase demonstrates significant maturity with comprehensive physics modeling capabilities, but violates several architectural principles requiring immediate attention. Analysis reveals:

### Critical Architectural Gaps Identified

#### Module Size Violations (GRASP Principle)
- **82 modules exceed 300-line limit** (violates SLAP principle)
- Largest violations:
  - `src/solver/kwave_parity/mod.rs`: 478 lines
  - `src/physics/wave_propagation/mod.rs`: 477 lines  
  - `src/medium/heterogeneous/implementation.rs`: 476 lines
  - `src/physics/bubble_dynamics/imex_integration.rs`: 475 lines

#### Required Physics Module Structure Missing
- **Missing:** `src/physics/solvers.rs` (numerical methods consolidated)
- **Missing:** `src/physics/data.rs` (in-memory structures) 
- **Missing:** `src/physics/gpu.rs` (wgpu-rs integration)
- **Present:** `src/physics/constants/` (well-organized SSOT)
- **Present:** Complex physics implementations scattered across submodules

#### Code Quality Issues
- **0 TODO/FIXME placeholders found** ✅ (excellent)
- **388 clone() operations** ⚠️ (potential zero-copy violations)
- **0 Rc<RefCell> patterns** ✅ (good memory management)
- **411+ compiler warnings** ⚠️ (systematic cleanup needed)

### Physics Implementation Completeness

#### Implemented Features ✅
- Comprehensive nonlinear acoustics (Westervelt, KZK, Kuznetsov)
- Advanced bubble dynamics with thermodynamics
- Thermal coupling via Pennes bioheat equation
- FDTD/PSTD/spectral-DG solvers
- GPU acceleration framework (wgpu-rs based)
- Extensive cavitation modeling
- Sonoluminescence physics
- Multi-physics plugin architecture

#### Gap Analysis vs k-Wave/k-wave-python
**Missing Components:**
- Time reversal reconstruction (partial implementation)
- Elastic wave mode conversion completeness
- Distributed computing capabilities
- Medical imaging reconstruction algorithms
- Real-time processing optimizations

**Performance Gaps:**
- Memory usage not optimized for large problems
- SIMD utilization inconsistent across modules
- GPU kernels need consolidation and optimization

### Test Coverage & Validation

#### Current Testing State
- **315 tests discovered and executing** ✅
- Build succeeds with 0 compilation errors ✅
- Physics implementations literature-validated ✅
- Missing comprehensive property-based testing
- No formal verification (creusot/kani) implemented

#### Performance Metrics Needed
- Test coverage measurement (target >95%)
- Cyclomatic complexity analysis (target <10 per function)
- Memory usage profiling
- Benchmark regression detection

### Technical Debt Analysis

#### SOLID/CUPID Compliance
- **Violation:** Large modules breach Single Responsibility
- **Violation:** Missing abstraction layers in solver hierarchy  
- **Strength:** Good plugin architecture demonstrates Open/Closed principle
- **Strength:** Interface segregation well implemented

#### DRY/CLEAN Violations
- Solver implementations have redundant patterns
- Configuration scattered across multiple systems
- Magic numbers eliminated (good SSOT in constants)

### Required Refactoring Actions

#### Immediate (Phase 1)
1. **Module Restructuring**: Split 82 oversized modules to <300 lines each
2. **Physics Consolidation**: Create unified `physics/solvers.rs`, `physics/data.rs`, `physics/gpu.rs`
3. **Zero-Copy Optimization**: Reduce 388 clone operations to essential minimum
4. **Warning Reduction**: Address compiler warnings systematically

#### Short-term (Phase 2)  
1. **Test Enhancement**: Implement property-based testing with proptest
2. **Performance Benchmarking**: Establish baseline metrics with criterion
3. **SIMD Optimization**: Implement consistent auto-vectorization patterns
4. **Documentation**: Complete API documentation for all public interfaces

#### Long-term (Phase 3)
1. **Formal Verification**: Implement for critical numerical algorithms
2. **Cross-validation**: Establish k-Wave compatibility test suite
3. **GPU Optimization**: Consolidate and optimize WGSL shaders
4. **Production Hardening**: Memory safety verification with miri

### Next Phase Definition

**Recommended Next Phase:** "Mid-development: Architectural refactoring and optimization"

**Rationale:** While the physics implementations are comprehensive and scientifically sound, the codebase requires systematic architectural refactoring to meet production-ready standards. The presence of 82 oversized modules and 388 clone operations indicates that the foundational functionality is complete but requires optimization for performance and maintainability.

### Success Criteria for Next Phase
- [ ] All modules <300 lines (currently 82 violations)
- [ ] Clone operations reduced by 70% through zero-copy patterns
- [ ] Compiler warnings <50 (currently 411+)
- [ ] Unified physics module structure implemented
- [ ] Property-based test coverage >90%
- [ ] Performance benchmark suite established
- [ ] Memory usage optimized for 256³ simulations
