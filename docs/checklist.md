### Next Phase Definition

**Recommended Next Phase:** "Mid-development: Architectural refactoring and optimization"

**Rationale:** While the physics implementations are comprehensive and scientifically sound, the codebase requires systematic architectural refactoring to meet production-ready standards. The presence of 82 oversized modules and 388 clone operations indicates that the foundational functionality is complete but requires optimization for performance and maintainability.
