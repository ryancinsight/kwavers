- Parallel execution with rayon data parallelism (✅ Available)
- GPU acceleration for compute-intensive operations (✅ WGPU integration)

### Test Infrastructure (Sprint 102 Update - Test Tier Optimization Complete)

**Test Execution Strategy** (SRS NFR-002 COMPLIANT - 16.81s execution):

#### TIER 1: Fast Tests (<30s target - ACHIEVED: 16.81s)
- **Library Unit Tests**: 371 focused unit tests with reduced computational grids
- **Grid Sizes**: 8³-32³ (down from 64³-128³ in comprehensive tests)
- **Iteration Counts**: 3-20 steps (down from 100-200 in comprehensive tests)
- **Coverage**: Core functionality validation with smoke tests
- **CI/CD Usage**: Run on every commit via `cargo test --lib`
- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLIANT** - 16.81s execution (44% faster than 30s target)
- **Test Count**: 371 pass, 4 fail (pre-existing), 8 ignored (Tier 3)

#### TIER 2: Integration Tests (<60s target)
- **Integration Test Files**: 19 test files in tests/ directory
- **Execution**: Individual test files complete in <30s each
- **CI/CD Usage**: Run on PR validation before merge
- **Status**: ⚠️ Some have API mismatches (deferred to Sprint 103)

#### TIER 3: Comprehensive Validation (>30s, marked #[ignore])
- **Comprehensive Physics Tests**: 8 ignored tests with full grids and iteration counts
- **Grid Sizes**: 64³-128³ with 100-1000 steps
- **Examples**:
  - `test_energy_conservation_linear`: 64³ grid, 200 steps
  - `test_nonlinear_harmonic_generation`: 128×64×64 grid, 1000 steps
  - `test_gaussian_beam_propagation`: 64²×128 grid, 10 propagation steps
  - `test_gaussian_beam_diffraction`: Full Rayleigh distance propagation
  - `test_multi_bowl_phases`: 32³ grid source generation
- **Execution**: Run via `cargo test --lib -- --ignored`
- **CI/CD Usage**: Run on release validation and nightly builds
- **Status**: ✅ Available for thorough validation when needed

**Test Tier Design Decisions**:
1. **Reduced Grids**: Fast tests use 8³-32³ instead of 64³-128³ (64-512x fewer cells)
2. **Fewer Steps**: Fast tests use 3-20 steps instead of 100-1000 (5-50x faster)
3. **Smoke Test Philosophy**: Fast tests verify solver runs without panicking, not numerical accuracy
4. **Comprehensive Validation**: Full accuracy tests marked #[ignore] for on-demand execution
5. **Zero Friction CI/CD**: Developers get <17s feedback on every commit

**Recommended Commands**:
- Fast CI/CD: `cargo test --lib` (371 tests, 16.81s) ✅ **RECOMMENDED**
- Comprehensive: `cargo test --lib -- --ignored` (8 tests, >5min)
- Integration: `cargo test --test <test_name>` (individual integration tests)
- Full suite: `cargo test` (all tests, includes integration tests)
