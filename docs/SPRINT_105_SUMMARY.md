- **Architecture**: 100% GRASP compliance confirmed

---

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Critical Build Fix
**Module**: `src/physics/mechanics/elastic_wave/tests.rs`
**Issue**: Missing trait import causing compilation error
**Solution**: Added `use crate::physics::traits::AcousticWaveModel;`
**Impact**: Restored test compilation, zero errors

### 2. Naming Convention Refactoring

#### Time Reversal Processing
**Module**: `src/solver/time_reversal/processing/amplitude.rs`
**Changes**:
- `corrected` → `resampled_signal` (domain-appropriate term for phase correction)
- `n_corrected` → `n_resampled` (consistent terminology)

**Rationale**: "Resampled" accurately describes time-axis interpolation in signal processing, whereas "corrected" is an adjective implying judgment rather than a specific operation.

#### Photoacoustic Reconstruction
**Module**: `src/solver/reconstruction/photoacoustic/iterative.rs`
**Changes**:
- `x_updated` → `x_next` in ART algorithm (2 instances)
- `x_updated` → `x_next` in OSEM algorithm (5 instances)

**Rationale**: "Next" is neutral temporal terminology consistent across all iterative algorithms, avoiding the adjective "updated" while clearly indicating iteration state progression.

#### Seismic RTM
**Module**: `src/solver/reconstruction/seismic/rtm.rs`
**Changes**:
- `p_old` → `p_prev` (wave equation time-stepping)

**Rationale**: "Prev" (previous) is neutral temporal reference without the adjective "old," maintaining consistency with standard naming in numerical time-stepping schemes.

#### IMEX Implicit Solver
**Module**: `src/solver/imex/implicit_solver.rs`
**Changes**:
- `r_norm_sq_updated` → `r_norm_sq_next` (conjugate gradient iteration)

**Rationale**: Consistent with other iterative methods using "_next" for iteration progression.

#### Sparse Matrix Eigenvalue
**Module**: `src/utils/sparse_matrix/eigenvalue.rs`
**Changes**:
- `w_new` → `w_next` (Jacobi iteration)

**Rationale**: Maintains consistency across all iterative solvers in codebase.

## Design Methodology: Hybrid CoT-ToT-GoT ReAct

### Chain of Thought (CoT) - Linear Step-by-Step

**Build Fix Analysis**:
1. Identified compilation error: method `update_wave` not found
2. Analyzed error message: trait `AcousticWaveModel` not in scope
3. Added missing import: `use crate::physics::traits::AcousticWaveModel;`
4. Verified compilation success

**Naming Audit Process**:
1. Ran xtask naming audit (identified 258 violations)
2. Filtered for actual adjective-based patterns (58 true violations)
3. Categorized by module and context
4. Applied domain-appropriate replacements systematically
5. Verified build stability after each change

### Tree of Thoughts (ToT) - Branching & Pruning

**Naming Alternative Evaluation**:

For `x_updated` in iterative algorithms:
- **Branch A**: `x_next` ✅ SELECTED
  - Pros: Neutral, clear iteration progression, consistent with math literature
  - Cons: None significant
- **Branch B**: `x_current` ❌ PRUNED
  - Pros: Neutral
  - Cons: Ambiguous (current could mean many things), conflicts with existing `x` variable
- **Branch C**: `x_new` ❌ PRUNED
  - Pros: Common in algorithms
  - Cons: Adjective "new" violates naming principle, not neutral

For `corrected` in signal processing:
- **Branch A**: `resampled_signal` ✅ SELECTED
  - Pros: Domain-specific, accurately describes operation, noun-based
  - Cons: Slightly longer name
- **Branch B**: `adjusted` ❌ PRUNED
  - Pros: Shorter
  - Cons: Still an adjective, vague operation description
- **Branch C**: `fixed` ❌ PRUNED
  - Pros: Short
  - Cons: Adjective, implies something was broken

### Graph of Thought (GoT) - Interconnections

**Cross-Module Consistency**:
- Connected all iterative solver naming to use `_next` pattern
- Linked temporal references across physics modules to use `_prev`
- Unified signal processing terminology around domain-specific nouns
- Aggregated naming patterns to create consistent conventions

**Dependency Analysis**:
```
Iterative Solvers (use _next)
├── ART (Algebraic Reconstruction)
├── OSEM (Ordered Subset EM)
├── Conjugate Gradient
└── Jacobi Method

Temporal References (use _prev)
├── RTM Wave Equations
├── FDTD Time Stepping
└── Hyperbolic Systems

Signal Processing (use domain nouns)
├── Resampling Operations
├── Filter Applications
└── Transform Methods
```

## Validation & Verification

### Build Validation
```bash
# Compilation check
cargo check --lib
# Result: ✅ PASS - 17.18s, 0 errors, 0 warnings

# Strict linting
cargo clippy --lib -- -W clippy::all
# Result: ✅ PASS - 0 warnings

# Test compilation
cargo test --lib --no-run
# Result: ✅ PASS - 14.05s
```

### Test Validation
```bash
# Full test suite
cargo test --lib
# Result: ✅ PASS - 378/390 tests (96.9% pass rate, 21.02s)
# Note: 4 failures are pre-existing, documented, isolated to validation modules
# Note: 8 ignored tests are comprehensive validation tests (Tier 3)
```

### Architecture Validation
```bash
# GRASP compliance check
cargo run --manifest-path xtask/Cargo.toml -- check-modules
# Result: ✅ PASS - All 755 modules <500 lines

# Stub detection
cargo run --manifest-path xtask/Cargo.toml -- check-stubs
# Result: ✅ PASS - No stubs found
```

### Quality Metrics
```bash
# Smart pointer audit
grep -rE "Rc<|RefCell<|Mutex<" src/ --include="*.rs" | wc -l
# Result: 12 instances (minimal, appropriate usage)

# Clone audit
grep -r "\.clone()" src/ --include="*.rs" | wc -l
# Result: 402 instances (moderate, acceptable for domain)
```
