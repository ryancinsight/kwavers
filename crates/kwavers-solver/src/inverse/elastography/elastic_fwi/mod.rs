//! Elastic / shear-wave full-waveform inversion (ADR 033).
//!
//! Adjoint-state FWI that reconstructs the Lamé shear modulus `μ(x)` from
//! post-burst shear-wave displacement data, closing the Ch26 §26 / Ch11 §11.14
//! "not implemented" disclosure. It is the full-waveform refinement of the
//! linear [`super::ShearWaveInversion`] (`c_S` → `μ = ρ c_S²`): where the linear
//! method resolves a smooth shear-speed map, the FWI resolves sub-wavelength
//! stiffness contrast by fitting the entire waveform.
//!
//! ## Method
//!
//! Mirrors the acoustic [`crate::inverse::fwi`] control flow
//! (forward → residual → adjoint → gradient → regularize → line search) with the
//! elastic physics swapped in:
//!
//! 1. **Forward** — the [`ElasticWaveSolver`] is run over the current `μ` map
//!    from a localized shear-wave source (point forces), recording the
//!    displacement traces `d_syn(x_r, t)` at the receivers.
//! 2. **Adjoint** — the per-component, time-reversed displacement residual is
//!    injected at the receivers as a body force and run through the *same*
//!    elastic solver (the elastic operator is self-adjoint), yielding the adjoint
//!    field `λ`.
//! 3. **Gradient** — the shear-modulus sensitivity kernel (Tromp, Tape & Liu
//!    2005; Köhn 2011)
//!    `K_μ(x) = −∫ Σ_ij (∂_i u_j + ∂_j u_i)_fwd (∂_i u_j + ∂_j u_i)_adj dt`
//!    assembled by a strain cross-correlation imaging condition.
//!
//! ## Scope
//!
//! 2-D plane strain (`nz = 1`) and full 3-D, with `μ` as the only inversion
//! parameter (`ρ` and `λ` remain fixed from the medium).
//! The forward field history is stored in full (`O(n_steps·N)`): the PML +
//! velocity-Verlet stepping is **not** time-reversible, so the acoustic
//! self-adjoint reconstruction trick (ADR 016) does not apply. Adjoint states
//! are consumed by the gradient kernel as they are produced, retaining only
//! `O(N)` adjoint state. Forward checkpointing and joint `λ/ρ` are deferred; the
//! PyO3 binding, L-BFGS optimizer, and 3-D kernel are implemented (ADR 033).
