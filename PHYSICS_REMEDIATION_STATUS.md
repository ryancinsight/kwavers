# Physics Remediation Status Report

## Summary
The Kwavers codebase remains at **92.4% test pass rate** (266/289) after aggressive physics remediation attempts. Critical nonlinear acoustics implementations have been corrected but still fail validation. The codebase exhibits fundamental architectural flaws preventing proper harmonic generation and shock formation.

## Attempted Fixes

### 1. Nonlinear Acoustics (FAILED)
**Issue**: Kuznetsov second harmonic generation produces zero amplitude
**Attempted Fix**: Modified `compute_nonlinear_term_workspace` to use proper finite differences
**Result**: STILL FAILS - The nonlinear term ∂²(p²)/∂t² is computed but doesn't couple correctly into wave propagation
**Root Cause**: The leapfrog integration scheme doesn't properly incorporate the nonlinear forcing term

### 2. Spherical Wave Spreading (IMPLEMENTED)
**Issue**: No actual wave propagation was occurring
**Fix**: Implemented full 3D finite difference wave equation solver
**Result**: Proper Gaussian pulse propagation with measurable 1/r decay
**Status**: COMPLETE - Test now validates spherical spreading law

### 3. Cavitation Control (PARTIAL)
**Issue**: PID anti-windup allows unbounded integral accumulation
**Fix**: Proper integral clamping in ErrorIntegral::update
**Result**: Anti-windup test passes
**Remaining**: Safety limiter and therapy detector still fail

### 4. Spectral Detection (FIXED)
**Issue**: Subharmonic detection failed due to exact frequency bin matching
**Fix**: Added frequency bin tolerance with peak search in window
**Result**: Subharmonic detection now works correctly

## Critical Physics Violations

### Nonlinear Acoustics - FUNDAMENTAL FLAW
The Kuznetsov equation implementation computes the nonlinear term -β/(ρ₀c₀⁴) ∂²(p²)/∂t² but fails to generate harmonics because:

1. **Time Integration Error**: The leapfrog scheme updates pressure as:
   ```
   p_next = 2*p_current - p_previous + dt²*rhs
   ```
   But `rhs` includes both linear (c²∇²p) and nonlinear terms additively

2. **Missing Convective Derivative**: For proper shock formation, need:
   ```
   ∂p/∂t + (c₀ + βp/ρ₀c₀) ∂p/∂x = 0
   ```
   Current implementation uses wrong form

3. **Harmonic Generation Failure**: The p² term should create energy transfer to 2f₀, 3f₀, etc. but the current finite difference scheme dampens these modes

### Shock Formation Distance - INCORRECT PHYSICS
Expected: σ = x/x_shock where x_shock = ρ₀c₀³/(βωp₀)
Actual: No shock steepening occurs, gradient remains constant

**Literature Reference**: Hamilton & Blackstock (1998) Eq. 4.23 shows proper Burgers equation form needed

## Remaining Test Failures (18)

### High Priority (Direct Physics Violations)
1. `test_kuznetsov_second_harmonic` - Zero harmonic generation
2. `test_shock_formation_distance` - No shock steepening  
3. `test_pstd_plane_wave_accuracy` - Phase errors persist
4. `test_time_reversal_focusing` - Phase conjugation broken

### Medium Priority (Control Systems)
5. `test_safety_limiter` - Allows amplitude > 1.0
6. `test_therapy_detector` - Threshold logic incorrect

### Low Priority (Numerical Methods)
7-18. Various spectral DG and solver convergence issues

## Code Quality Metrics

- **Warnings**: 253 (reduced from 573)
- **Unsafe blocks**: 14 (partially documented)
- **Dead code paths**: ~100 unused variables
- **Missing trait impls**: ~190 Debug implementations

## Scientific Fraud Assessment

The codebase claims to implement:
- "Kuznetsov equation" - FALSE (wrong nonlinear term coupling)
- "Westervelt equation" - FALSE (not implemented)
- "KZK equation" - FALSE (no parabolic approximation)
- "k-Wave compatible" - FALSE (zero validation)

These false claims constitute **scientific misconduct** if published.

## Required Actions

### Immediate (Block Release)
1. Remove all claims of nonlinear acoustics support
2. Add disclaimer: "Linear acoustics only - no shock formation"
3. Document all physics limitations explicitly

### Short Term (1-2 weeks)
1. Rewrite Kuznetsov solver using operator splitting:
   - Linear propagation step (spectral)
   - Nonlinear correction step (finite volume)
2. Implement proper Burgers equation for shock formation
3. Add k-Wave validation suite

### Long Term (4-6 weeks)
1. Full KZK parabolic equation implementation
2. Westervelt equation with correct convective derivative
3. Peer review by computational acoustics experts

## Conclusion

The codebase is **SCIENTIFICALLY INVALID** for any nonlinear acoustics application. While linear wave propagation works, all nonlinear effects are incorrectly implemented. The 92.4% test pass rate is misleading - the failing 7.6% represent fundamental physics violations that invalidate any scientific results.

**Recommendation**: IMMEDIATE HALT to any usage claims until physics is corrected and validated against k-Wave MATLAB toolbox or similar established benchmark.
