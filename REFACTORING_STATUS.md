# Kwavers Codebase Refactoring Status

## Phase: Aggressive Architectural Decomposition

### Completed Actions

1. **Redundant Documentation Cleanup**
   - Removed 8 redundant assessment files (FINAL_ASSESSMENT.md, PHASE2_ASSESSMENT.md, etc.)
   - Consolidated documentation to essential files only

2. **Naming Convention Corrections**
   - Fixed "Optimized" to "Second-order finite difference" in laplacian.rs
   - Fixed "Refactored" to "Domain coupling interface" in hybrid/mod.rs  
   - Fixed "Improved" to "Amplitude preservation" in fwi/gradient.rs

3. **Stub Implementation Elimination**
   - Replaced TODO implementations in seismic/fwi/wavefield.rs with full forward/adjoint wave modeling
   - Added complete finite difference stencil implementation
   - Implemented PML boundary conditions
   - Added Ricker wavelet source generation

4. **Module Structure Creation**
   - Created src/medium/core.rs with CoreMedium and ArrayAccess traits
   - Created src/physics/phase_modulation/phase_shifting/core.rs with phase shifting operations
   - Created src/physics/mechanics/cavitation/core.rs with cavitation detection functions

### Current Issues (134 Compilation Errors)

1. **Trait Method Mismatches**
   - CoreMedium trait missing: density(), sound_speed(), reference_frequency()
   - ArrayAccess trait missing: density_array_mut(), sound_speed_array_mut()

2. **Missing Imports/Constants**
   - phase_shifting::core missing: calculate_wavelength, MAX_FOCAL_POINTS, MIN_FOCAL_DISTANCE
   - Various quantize_phase, normalize_phase functions missing

3. **Architecture Violations Identified**
   - No true monolithic modules found (541-line dg_solver.rs is cohesive)
   - Module structure generally follows SOLID principles
   - Main issue is incomplete implementations rather than poor architecture

### Critical Scientific Validation Gaps

1. **Rayleigh-Plesset Implementation**
   - Lacks validation against Brennen's "Cavitation and Bubble Dynamics"
   - Missing comparison with Prosperetti's bubble oscillation models
   - No test cases from literature benchmarks

2. **Numerical Methods**
   - FDTD/PSTD implementations not validated against k-Wave toolbox
   - Missing CFL stability analysis documentation
   - No convergence tests with analytical solutions

3. **Physics Constants**
   - Magic numbers still present in some modules
   - Need centralization in constants module with literature citations

### Next Priority Actions

1. Fix compilation errors by completing trait definitions
2. Validate physics implementations against literature
3. Add comprehensive unit tests with known solutions
4. Implement zero-copy optimizations where applicable
5. Run cargo nextest to identify test failures

## Assessment

The codebase exhibits reasonable architectural foundations but suffers from incomplete implementations and lack of scientific validation. The primary issue is not monolithic design but rather partial implementations that compromise production readiness. The 305 Ok(()) patterns found are mostly legitimate success returns, not stubs. The real concern is the 134 compilation errors stemming from trait mismatches and missing helper functions that need immediate resolution before any meaningful testing or validation can occur.
