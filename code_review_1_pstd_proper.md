## Issues and Recommendations

1. **Issue:** Inefficient triple-nested loops for wavenumber initialization
   - **Rationale:** The `initialize_wavenumbers` method uses triple-nested loops with bounds checking on every iteration. This is a performance bottleneck for large grids (O(n³) with poor cache locality).
   - **Suggestion:**
   ```rust
   fn initialize_wavenumbers(&mut self) {
       use ndarray::parallel::prelude::*;
       use rayon::prelude::*;
       
       let nx = self.nx;
       let ny = self.ny;
       let nz = self.nz;
       let dx = self.dx;
       let dy = self.dy;
       let dz = self.dz;
       
       // Pre-compute wavenumber vectors
       let kx_vec: Vec<f64> = (0..nx).map(|i| {
           if i <= nx / 2 {
               2.0 * PI * i as f64 / (nx as f64 * dx)
           } else {
               2.0 * PI * (i as i32 - nx as i32) as f64 / (nx as f64 * dx)
           }
       }).collect();
       
       // Use broadcasting for efficient array construction
       self.kx = Array3::from_shape_fn((nx, ny, nz), |(i, _, _)| kx_vec[i]);
       self.ky = Array3::from_shape_fn((nx, ny, nz), |(_, j, _)| {
           if j <= ny / 2 {
               2.0 * PI * j as f64 / (ny as f64 * dy)
           } else {
               2.0 * PI * (j as i32 - ny as i32) as f64 / (ny as f64 * dy)
           }
       });
       self.kz = Array3::from_shape_fn((nx, ny, nz), |(_, _, k)| {
           if k <= nz / 2 {
               2.0 * PI * k as f64 / (nz as f64 * dz)
           } else {
               2.0 * PI * (k as i32 - nz as i32) as f64 / (nz as f64 * dz)
           }
       });
   }
   ```
   - **Critique:** This optimization leverages `from_shape_fn` which provides better memory access patterns and allows the compiler to optimize more aggressively. For very large grids, consider using parallel initialization with rayon. This follows the principle of data-oriented design (Fabian, 2018, "Data-Oriented Design").

2. **Issue:** Missing validation for FFT plan initialization
   - **Rationale:** The code uses `Option<Fft3d>` but doesn't validate that FFT plans are initialized before use. This could lead to runtime panics when unwrapping None.
   - **Suggestion:**
   ```rust
   impl ProperPstdPlugin {
       fn ensure_fft_plans_initialized(&self) -> KwaversResult<()> {
           if self.fft_plan.is_none() || self.ifft_plan.is_none() {
               return Err(KwaversError::InvalidState(
                   "FFT plans not initialized. Call initialize() first.".to_string()
               ));
           }
           Ok(())
       }
       
       pub fn step(&mut self, dt: f64) -> KwaversResult<()> {
           self.ensure_fft_plans_initialized()?;
           // ... rest of implementation
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Critique:** This defensive programming pattern ensures fail-fast behavior with clear error messages. Consider using the typestate pattern for compile-time guarantees (Sergio Benitez, 2016, "Type-State Programming in Rust").

3. **Issue:** Sinc function implementation missing and potential division by zero
   - **Rationale:** The code references `sinc` function which isn't defined in the visible scope. Additionally, sinc(x) = sin(x)/x has a removable singularity at x=0 that must be handled.
   - **Suggestion:**
   ```rust
   #[inline]
   fn sinc(x: f64) -> f64 {
       const EPSILON: f64 = 1e-10;
       if x.abs() < EPSILON {
           // Taylor series approximation near zero
           1.0 - x * x / 6.0 + x.powi(4) / 120.0
       } else {
           x.sin() / x
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Critique:** The Taylor series approximation ensures numerical stability near zero. The threshold EPSILON should be chosen based on machine precision. Reference: Numerical Recipes (Press et al., 2007).

4. **Issue:** Memory allocation in hot path for k-filter creation
   - **Rationale:** `create_k_filter` allocates a full Array3 even when correction is disabled, wasting memory and time.
   - **Suggestion:**
   ```rust
   fn create_k_filter(&mut self) {
       if !self.config.k_space_correction {
           self.k_filter = None;
           return;
       }
       
       // Use lazy evaluation with iterator
       self.k_filter = Some(Array3::from_shape_fn(
           (self.nx, self.ny, self.nz),
           |(i, j, k)| {
               let kx_val = self.kx[[i, j, k]];
               let ky_val = self.ky[[i, j, k]];
               let kz_val = self.kz[[i, j, k]];
               
               let sinc_x = sinc(kx_val * self.dx / 2.0);
               let sinc_y = sinc(ky_val * self.dy / 2.0);
               let sinc_z = sinc(kz_val * self.dz / 2.0);
               
               let base = sinc_x * sinc_y * sinc_z;
               match self.config.k_space_order {
                   1 => base,
                   2 => base * base,  // More efficient than powi(2)
                   n if n > 2 => base.powi(n as i32),
                   _ => 1.0,
               }
           }
       ));
   }
   ```
   - **Critique:** This approach avoids unnecessary allocation and uses more efficient operations (multiplication vs powi for square). The pattern matching is more exhaustive and handles edge cases.

5. **Issue:** Potential integer overflow in wavenumber calculation
   - **Rationale:** The expression `(i as i32 - self.nx as i32)` can overflow for large grid sizes where nx > i32::MAX.
   - **Suggestion:**
   ```rust
   fn compute_wavenumber(index: usize, size: usize, spacing: f64) -> f64 {
       let half_size = size / 2;
       if index <= half_size {
           2.0 * PI * index as f64 / (size as f64 * spacing)
       } else {
           // Use wrapping arithmetic to handle large grids safely
           let wrapped_index = index.wrapping_sub(size) as isize;
           2.0 * PI * wrapped_index as f64 / (size as f64 * spacing)
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Critique:** Using `isize` and wrapping arithmetic prevents overflow for grids up to platform limits. This follows Rust's safety principles while maintaining performance.

6. **Issue:** Default CFL safety factor may be too aggressive
   - **Rationale:** A CFL factor of 0.3 is very conservative for PSTD methods, which typically allow factors closer to 1.0 due to their spectral accuracy.
   - **Suggestion:**
   ```rust
   impl Default for PstdConfig {
       fn default() -> Self {
           Self {
               k_space_correction: true,
               k_space_order: 2,
               cfl_safety_factor: 0.8,  // PSTD allows higher CFL
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   - **Critique:** PSTD methods have different stability requirements than FDTD. The CFL condition for PSTD is c*dt/dx ≤ 2/π ≈ 0.64 for 1D, higher for 3D. See Fornberg (1987) "The pseudospectral method" for theoretical bounds.

7. **Issue:** Complex number array initialization inefficient
   - **Rationale:** Using `Array3::zeros()` for complex arrays allocates and zeros memory twice (real and imaginary parts).
   - **Suggestion:**
   ```rust
   // More efficient initialization
   p_curr: Array3::from_elem((1, 1, 1), Complex::zero()),
   // Or for uninitialized (when you'll overwrite immediately):
   p_work: unsafe { Array3::uninit((1, 1, 1)).assume_init() },
   ```
   - **Critique:** For large arrays that will be immediately overwritten, uninitialized allocation can save significant time. Use with caution and document safety invariants.
