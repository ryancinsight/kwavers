# Performance Improvements Summary

**Date**: January 2025  
**Improvements**: 2 performance-related fixes

## 1. Rayon Import for Parallel Processing ✅

### Issue
The `AnisotropicWavePropagator::compute_stress` function used `into_par_iter()` for parallel processing but was missing the required `rayon` import.

### Solution
Added `use rayon::prelude::*;` to enable parallel iteration over the spatial grid.

### Impact
- Enables parallel computation of stress from strain
- Significant speedup for large 3D grids
- Utilizes multiple CPU cores efficiently

## 2. VecDeque for Efficient History Management ✅

### Issue
The fractional derivative absorption used `Vec::pop()` followed by `Vec::insert(0, ...)` for managing pressure history, resulting in O(n) complexity for each update.

### Solution
Replaced `Vec<Array3<f64>>` with `VecDeque<Array3<f64>>`:
- `pop_back()` and `push_front()` are both O(1) operations
- Maintains the same FIFO behavior
- Pre-allocated with capacity to avoid reallocation

### Performance Analysis
For a history length of n:
- **Before**: O(n) per time step (shifting all elements)
- **After**: O(1) per time step (deque operations)
- **Speedup**: Linear improvement with history length

### Code Changes
```rust
// Before (inefficient)
memory.pressure_history.pop();           // O(1)
memory.pressure_history.insert(0, ...);  // O(n) - shifts all elements

// After (efficient)
memory.pressure_history.pop_back();      // O(1)
memory.pressure_history.push_front(...); // O(1)
```

## Benefits

1. **Parallel Processing**: Stress computation now scales with CPU cores
2. **Reduced Complexity**: History updates from O(n) to O(1)
3. **Better Scalability**: Performance remains constant regardless of history length
4. **Memory Efficiency**: VecDeque pre-allocation reduces allocations

## Conclusion

These improvements ensure:
- Better multi-core utilization for anisotropic materials
- Constant-time history management for fractional derivatives
- Improved scalability for long simulations with large history buffers

The changes maintain the same functionality while significantly improving performance characteristics.
